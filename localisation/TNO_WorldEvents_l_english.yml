 WORLD.2.t:0 "아돌프 히틀러의 사망"
 WORLD.2.d:0 "한 뉴스가 처음 독일국에서, 그 다음 전 세계로 퍼지면서 비극이 독일을 집어삼켰습니다. 독일의 총통이자 제2차 세계 대전의 승리자인 아돌프 히틀러가 사망하였습니다. 한동안 다들 총통의 건강이 악화되고 있다고 추정하였으나 그럼에도 사망 소식은 독일을 완전히 충격에 빠뜨렸습니다. 국가의회는 3개월간 애도 기간을 선포하며 총통은 그 전에 사망하였던 부인 에바 히틀러 곁에 묻힐 것이며 장례식에 전세계의 고관급 인사를 초대할 것이라고 발표하였습니다.\n\n독일이 애도에 빠진 동안, 전 세계에서 수많은 사람들이 세계를 30년간 고통에 빠뜨린 히틀러의 죽음을 축하하였습니다. 히지만 많은 국제 논평가들은 제3독일국 총통직의 정당한 후계자를 놓고 쓰라린 권력투쟁에 휘말리기 시작한 독일의 상황이 어떻게 될 지 두려워하고 있습니다."

 # WORLD.4.d:0 "Adolf Hitler, Führer of the Great German Reich, victor of the Second World War, is dead.\n\nWhile it came as a suprise to some, to most, it was not. Within Germany, the entire nation mourns the man who kept the Reich together through twenty years of strife. Outside the Reich, perhaps the largest celebration in history is occurring. From Washington to Tokyo, from Cape Town to Arkangelsk, people have taken to the streets, celebrating the death of the man who has thrown the world into so much misery.\n\nNow the question remains - what will become of the Third Reich without its leader?"

Idealists have managed to establish something resembling order in the South, but experience constant desertions as they struggle to mount an offensive on the central Shadom of Iran. Monarchist holdouts persist in isolated pockets, clinging against hope that their beloved Persia may live to see the daybreak.\n"

 WORLD.913.d:0 "After the death of King Farouk, the Egyptian monarchy entered a phase of crisis, with the successor, Fuad II, still not at adult age. In a bid to reinforce their dominance over the country, the Italian government has named duke Adalberto di Savoia-Genova as regent of Egypt. A prince of a branch of Italy's royal house, Adalberto is also the general in command of the Italian garrison in Egypt, and he plans to use his powers as regent to restore order in the country with any means necessary.\n\nA staggeringly unpopular move, Adalberto's nomination as regent intends to further subjugate Egypt and cement it as a vassal of Italy. Reactions to the news have been wildly negative, with condemnation coming even from the monarchist and conservative Wafd Party, generally the most supportive of Italy's presence in Egypt. As the Italian garrison is mobilizing to quell riots, many fear that Egypt is the first to fall victim to renewed Italian oppression in the countries and territories of the Empire.\n"

Nevertheless, many feel like the new course of the Montenegrin administration, led by governor Krsto Popović, won't be able to solve the numerous issues that plague the small Balkan country - chetnik bands are still dominant in the mountainous interior, while partisan attacks still target Italian troops in the region.

 novel.3.d:0 "Science fiction author Phillip K. Dick has released his latest novel, named "The Man in the Iron Fortress." A work of speculative alternate history, the novel takes place in a dystopian world where communism reigns supreme. The "point of divergence" in the story's history is that the socialist politician Eugene Debs remained with the Democrats, becoming president in 1920. As a result, he supported the nascent Soviet Union and the May Fourth movement in China. Debs' beliefs died with him in 1926, and his successor Robert La Follette proved to be far more isolationist, a trend that dominated American politics for the next twenty years. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union became dominated by the authoritarian Felix Dzerzhinsky, while the communists under Mao Tse-tung were able to unite China and counter-invade the Japanese. When the Nazis rose to power, they were able to crush the unsupported Allied nations of Europe, but were unprepared for a surprise Soviet invasion and were swiftly defeated. In 1947, a joint Sino-Soviet army invaded America, leading to them dividing the country north-south.\n\nThe novel is set within occupied America and follows a wide cast of characters, from a Cheka spy to a Chinese official obsessed with American cowboy culture. At the center of its plot is a book called "The Beast Among the Reeds," which tells of a world where both Nazism and Communism were defeated. The political backdrop is one of rapidly decaying Sino-Soviet relations; Dzerzhinsky is succeeded after his death by the even more totalitarian Lavrentiy Beria, and the threat of nuclear war looms on the horizon.\n\nDepsite the novel's criticism for seemingly unrealistic developments (the Soviets allegedly drained the Baltic Sea for farmland and built a giant bridge stretching across the Bering Strait between Russia and Alaska), Dick has defended the action as being plausible within the best available information he could acquire at the time. That still hasn't stopped the book from becoming a bestseller in the United States and Canada, and it has already been nominated for a Hugo Award."

Set in a surreal alternate history universe with few rules, the work is a multi-pronged satire on other, more serious alternate history works, as well as a scathing critique of the culture of the United States in the 1970s.\n\nThompson spends dozens of pages going into the minutia of each "divergence point", off-color vignettes within the overarching story that detail how the world of this novel ended up differing from our own. Irreverent and often nonsensical, these stories detail ridiculous episodes, such as a Japanese doctor in Unit 731 accidentally trying a hallucinogenic drug of his own concoction, leading him to paradrop an army of drugged-up "ghouls" into downtown Tokyo. While critics are somewhat split on these stories, casual readers tired of the over-saturation of the fiction market with cheap, overly-serious, "alt-history" novels have found them a welcome, if odd, diversion from the norm.\n\nLinking these various episodes together, Thompson has strung out a vague semblance of a plot in this alternate LA, mainly consisting of cheap allegories to attack contemporary American political culture. In one memorable scene, a street gang closely modeled after the Yockeyites beat up a demonstration of "old yuppie bigots" (Nixon supporters, also referred to as "bloodthirsty freaks"), all while an inebriated Thompson watches with juvenile glee.\n\nWhile critics and readers alike are split on the novel, most at least concede it is a scathing and effective critique of the current literary and political climate."

After unifying to destroy the German Empire, her allies, and the remnants of the Entente, the alliance quickly shatters, with the libertarian syndicalist Commune of France and Oswald Mosley's Union of Britain forging their own internationals and engaging in an apocalyptic nuclear war that leaves Europe and North America in ruins, while Russia and Japan engage in a similarly destructive schism. The world by 1962 is devastated by nuclear fallout and divided by a four-sided armistice threatening to either end civilization or enslave it under various flavours of totalitarianism.\n\nEnding with the "English Socialist" American Commonwealth tearing apart itself into a Third American Civil War as white supremacists revolt in the South, the novel has received analysis for its complex parallels with the violent conflicts occurring all around world, though some dismiss it as no different than the rest of the glut of alt-history novels that has been filling bookshelves in the recent years. Responding to critics, Orwell has addressed the implausibility of this universe by writing "...this universe is no less stranger than anything that has happened in ours for the last half-century.""

In Russia, Nikolai Bukharin loses to Joseph Stalin, who centralizes power and creates an almost nightmarish dictatorship that strengthens the Union. The Second World War is is started by the newly formed Deutsche Ordennsstaat, a military junta backed by the Kaiser, and is led by Hugenberg, Erwin Rommel and Erich Ludendorff (in the book, the junta is called the Crusader's Council).\n\nThe book takes place during the war, in occupied France. Its protagonist, Anne-Marie Manouchian, starts as a college professor teaching chemistry, but becomes a bombmaker after the school is shut down and many of its professors arrested for promoting anti-German ideals. During her struggle, she meets the two other primary protagonists; Jack, an OSS agent helping the resistance, and Nikolai, a Soviet agent running guns to communist militias. As the story goes on, the three primary factions emerge; first, the Imperial Entente, a faction led by a more reactionary United Kingdom and a Bonapartist France. Second, the Alliance of Soviets, a Russia-led faction poised at spreading world communism. Finally, there exists the Pacific Joint-Defense Group, an alliance led by a more democratic Japan and the United States.\n\nThe book ends with Anne-Marie witnessing the nuclear bombing of the city of Dresden, while Nikolai says that "this is not an end, but a beginning to a world torn open by flame. Your children shall be communists, or you shall not have children." The book has been criticized by many as being overly pessimistic and heavy on details, but others have insisted that this could have been a reality had things played out differently.

Though the Emperor eventually prevails, Japan never recovers and opts to lick its wounds rather than embark on the conquests it did in our world. Thus, once the Germans are pushing across England and the United States finally intervenes, they are not distracted by the fighting in the Pacific and manage to defeat and occupy Germany. The defeated Reich is split into two halves: The German People's Republic, a Soviet puppet state consisting of the north, and the Republic of Germany, an allied occupation zone with self-government consisting of the south, the Rhineland, and Austria.

Having learned from the mistakes of the past, South Germany is quickly invaded and the old government reinstated by the Allies. The story follows a poor German youth who is believed to be a nationalist by the occupying Western powers. Although he isn't at the start of the book, his unjustified persecution by the occupiers eventually leads him to become one, and the book hints that this is part of an endless cycle that will always lead to oppression and violence by one side. It also hints that something similar and far more dangerous may occur with the now-recovered Japan.\n\nThe book has proven stunningly controversial. Many claim it is Nazi schlock, trying to clear them of wrongdoing and insinuating that their reaction to Versailles was justified.Others claim that it is simply unrealistic, and that Japan's communist movement would have never been strong enough to do the damage the book has them do. The author says they are all missing the point, and that the book is more about the message rather than the setting."

 novel.13.t:0 "SSR-Ostpreussen"
 novel.13.d:0 "This week, author Len Deighton published his newest novel, SSR-Ostpreussen. The novel takes place in an alternate history where Mikhail Tukhachevsky launches a coup against Bukharin in the late 1920s, transforming the Soviet Union into a military state comparable to Napoleon's France. "The New Bonaparte," as he is styled, launches numerous invasions of eastern Europe and Scandinavia at a time when the rest of the world is still reeling from the Great Depression and unable to respond, significantly strengthening the Soviets' position. Hitler's Germany finds a much tougher opponent in this Union and the war between the two lasts for many years, until both sides are forced into peace after each discovers the atomic bomb simultaneously and the cities of Königsberg and Kiev are annihilated.\n\nThe story focuses on a commissar of the Red Army who has been assigned to oversee the reconstruction of Soviet-held Königsberg, now rechristened Stalingrad after a close ally of Tukhachevsky. Upon discovering the murder of a prominent government official, the commissar finds himself embroiled in a byzantine web of plots involving the Soviet high command, the local garrison, and partisans from the heavily oppressed and radiation-scarred German inhabitants of the city. Hints are laid throughout the story of greater goings on behind the scenes, such as massive instability in German-controlled western Europe and extensive Soviet military campaigns in northern Iran and western China. The story ends with the commissar narrowly escaping death at the hands of his superiors and uncovering a plot to provoke the Reich into a new war.\n\nThe book has drawn praised for its unique take on the noir genre and its gritty setting amidst the burned-out streets of Stalingrad. Some have criticised it for its somewhat sympathetic portrayal of the German characters, with a few even going as far as to suggest that Deighton may possess Nazi ideals. Regardless, it has already had a quite successful first run of sales and is expected to become a staple of alternate history for years to come."

Having been forced back into his role after the German occupation and the exile of King George VI, the king has remained deeply unpopular amongst both the aristocracy and the people for his marriage to a commoner and his collaboration with the German Reich, respectively. The ex-king and his wife, Wallis Simpson, are expected to retire shortly to their private residence in the Bahamas capital of Nassau.\n\nWhile the public may be glad to see the back of him, the English government now faces the task of filling the empty throne. Elizabeth Windsor, daughter of former King George VI, is the pundits' favorite to become the next monarch. However, with the now defeated resistance group HMMLR having so deeply ingrained her image with their organization, the government is also considering other options less tinged by controversy."

The West Russian Revolutionary Front, long thought crushed under the German boot, has spread and tightened its grip over West Russia and tamed the many battling warlords under the careful direction of Grand Marshal Georgy Zhukov.\n\nA well-known and respected reformist, Grand Marshal Zhukov has already begun further solidifying his grasp on the west, fortifying the Moskowien border and rebuilding infrastructure, even as the Red Army prepares to march east to the Urals.

The threats to the regime are few and small, with most experts on Russian affairs agreeing that a force equal to the old socialist republic has arisen.

Mikhail II's legitimacy due to his parent's morganatic marriage notwithstanding, the Tsar has already made a number of public appearances even before Sobchak's announcement promising a strong hand in dealing with Nazi Germany.

His speech announcing the unification of Russia also included virulent hatred towards those he referred to as "the perfidious Germans", claiming that the Germans had failed in forging a national socialist society and called upon "all true Russians" to serve in what appears to be an upcoming conflict between the two fascist governments.

There was less than a minute for the Americans to respond. Tens of thousands of people are now ash and little remains of the once beautiful island.\n\nPeoples from around the world watch with unbidden terror; for this time the United States has a means to respond.

WORLD.16515.d:0 "Following a grueling years-long conflict all across the vast reaches of the Indonesian archipelago, the loyalist government of Soekarno has triumphed over the National Front, led by Mohammad Hatta. The father of the young nation, Soekarno has had a contentious, at times hostile relationship with his Japanese benefactors. One could not deny however, the importance of Japanese backing in securing his victory.\n\nInternational observers note however of the continued plight of the Indonesian people under his continued reign, with the Romusha system and the Shinmakinaoshi economic arrangement with the Empire of Japan still in place. Only time can tell whether Bung Karno is able to lift Indonesia into a new, golden era under Japanese guidance."

WORLD.16516.d:0 "Following a grueling years-long conflict all across the vast reaches of the Indonesian archipelago, the rag-tag and diverse National Front under former Vice President Mohammad Hatta has triumphed over Sukarno's loyalists. A Minangkabau intellectual with a Dutch-educated background, Hatta was a former ally of Sukarno throughout the early years of the Republic - until Sukarno's government took a turn towards despotism.\n\nHatta's victory is watched by the world very excitedly, with his proclamation of a democratic, prosperous and free Indonesia. Only time will tell whether his diverse coalition of socialists, liberals, communists and Islamists would last the test of governance, as well as continued pressure from the United States."

WORLD.16517.d:0 "Exhaustion drives men to desperation, and no situation could exemplify that situation better than the current developments in Indonesia. Following years of drawn-out conflict and with military forces on both the Jakarta government and the National Front wiping themselves out to exhaustion, a little-known general named Suharto has risen to the occasion and launched a coup d'etat against the Sukarno government.\n\nPledging to bring an era of prosperity and sewing together the divisions within Indonesian society, Suharto has allowed Mohammad Hatta to return from the provisional capital of Port Moresby, and to form an Unity Government with Hatta as president. Time will tell however, whether Suharto's coup will set a precedence for the Indonesian military to intervene in politics."

WORLD.16518.d:0 "It seems as though peace ruled the day following Sukarno's victory in the Indonesian Civil War, with business resuming as usual - until today, at least. Reports of armoured columns and airborne forces seizing vital positions all over Indonesia are confirmed, with paramilitaries and units loyal to Sukarno being taken under custody or shot. Widely rumoured to be a Japanese or Commmunist coup, the situation amongst Indonesia's civilian populace has been dire.\n\nRumours point to the coup being orchestrated by one of Indonesia's war heroes, however. A source claims to have documents confirming the role of General Suharto in orchestrating a coup against the Sukarno administration - though this is confusing, given Suharto's professed loyalty to Sukarno."

WORLD.18000.desc:0 "Following another landslide election, Gustavo Díaz Ordaz of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional has been elected President of the Republic of Mexico. The Secretary of the Interior is infamous for his callous, heavy-handed treatment of anti-government protests during the Mateos administration, leaving dissidents within the country fearful for their already dangerous future.\n\nRegardless, the United States has extended its congratulations to Mexico for "electing a leader who can guide the country through these times of tumult". It seems Mexico is poised to enter the world stage once more - and this time, under the Americans' guidance."

WORLD.18001.desc:0 "After yet another landslide election, Raúl Salinas Lozano of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional has been elected President of the Republic of Mexico. A rare free trade advocate within his party, the country's Secretary of Industry and Commerce is decried both by opposition and fellow PRI for "betraying the Revolution in practice".\n\nHis victory comes as an unsettling shock to local businesses enjoying protectionist policies - but also as a welcome surprise to enterprises from Japan. As congratulations are exchanged across the Pacific, Mexico seems ready to enter the world with an eye towards the horizon's Rising Sun."

The Secretary of Foreign Affairs is an enigma even to his close supporters, oftentimes siding with and against the party line in the same issue. His reputation as a political maverick endears Echeverría's little to both aisles of Mexican government.\n\nOnly one idea remains constant throughout the new President's duplicity: his insistence on the country's sovereignty and its ruling party's principles. Mexico will finally rejoin the global community - but this time, he pledges, on its own terms and two feet."

WORLD.18003.desc:0 "Led by Mr. Trudeau, the Canadian Liberal Party has won the federal elections. Despite the dangers predicted by many analysts, the party's careful strategy of both cooperating with America and defending Canadian interests has earned Canada a good reputation abroad and strong domestic economic progress.\n\nSucceeding Pearson as party chief is the journalist from Montréal Pierre Elliot Trudeau. Known as a radical advocate of French Canadian interests in his youth, Trudeau has in recent years refashioned himself into a staunch defender of Liberalism and of a vision of a bilingual, multicultural Canada. Ignoring as always those who criticize him and his ideas, the new Prime Minister has ridden a wave of Trudeaumania into 24 Sussex."

WORLD.18004.desc:0 "After a hard fought election John Diefenbaker has led the Progressive Conservative party to victory in the Canadian Federal Elections. The Conservative's path to victory was no doubt aided by their staunch defense of Canadian interests in the face of American dominance. Their more controversial policies of hawkishness with regard to European affairs and refusal to negotiate with French Canadian nationalists have helped them make surprising gains in the commons.\n\nThis victory has no doubt been helped by Diefenbaker himself. A forceful member of the party's populist left wing, the new Prime Minister's tireless defense of ordinary Canadian citizens and of their rights to freedom and prosperity in a complex world has helped him revive the fortunes of the Conservative party."

Riding a tide of popular anger at the dominating presence of American businesses in Canada, the CCF is expected to work on reforming healthcare and introducing a bill of rights among other domestic reforms. Abroad, the party is known for its tireless opposition to fascism and its criticism of America's dominance of the OFN.\n\nA baptist minister by trade, Tommy Douglas formed North America's first democratic socialist government in Saskatchewan, and brought many innovative policies forward. He is now expected to expand his effort at the federal level."
