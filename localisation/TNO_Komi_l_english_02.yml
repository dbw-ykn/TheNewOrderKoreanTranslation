 komiintro.0.t:0 "The Republic"
 komiintro.0.d:0 "The Komi Republic - a rare democracy within the Russian Anarchy. Almost unique for a statelet in the bomb-ravaged west, the Republic functions as an independent nation-state, with a formalized economy, political system, and the closest thing to free elections that one is likely to get in West Russia.\n\nEver since the foundation of the Republic in the wake of the West Russian War, putting an end to the political violence that plagued Syktyvkar beforehand, the Republic has stood strong, its borders spanning from the Vychegda to the Vyatka Rivers, and its economy managing to grow slowly and steadily.\n\nHowever, the foundation of the Republic did not end the woes of Syktyvkar and the Komi region in general. The city of Syktyvkar, during the West Russian War, gained a reputation as a cutthroat and critical node of the Front's governing apparatus. Former political prisoners and ideologues were set free to ply their trades in the city, as the authority that ran their former prisons dissolved. Political refugees from all corners of West Russia fled into the Republic - socialists and republicans from Vyatka and right-wingers from Arkhangelsk mingled freely in the teeming capital of the Republic.\n\nKomi is known for its democracy, indeed, but the results of this reputation as a place of freedom has acquired an ugly side - the paramilitaries.\n\nThe streets of Syktyvkar are infamous for their bouts of political paramilitary violence, protests and riots. With the second national-level election approaching in late 1963, this violence has only been growing, and many of the citizens of the Republic wonder - can democracy survive in Komi, or is it doomed to fall to despotism like the rest of the Russian anarchy?"
 komiintro.0.a:0 "We shall bear the torch forevermore."

 komiintro.1.t:0 "The Custodian"
 komiintro.1.d:0 "The workday of Nikolai Voznesensky passed in an unbearable, soul-crushing yet in no way carefree routine. Only having reached the threshold of the presidential residence with his leisurely step, the President was immediately caught in the intrigues and schemes of the Komi politics, dealing with the chaos that engulfed the newborn Republic. The chaos to which he no less than the radicals he despised.\n\nIn a short moment of distraction, Voznesensky could not help but indulge himself in reminiscences about the early days of the Republic, the time when everything seemed so easy, so achievable. The applauding crowd in the speech hall, the lowered Soviet flag, the cheering demonstrations for the new era in the Russian democracy - it looked so vivid and yet so dissonant with his new reality.\n\nThe idealistic memories of the birth of the Republic were darkened by the image of Zhdanov, a Janus-faced and smug creature accompanied by Suslov, the Mephistopheles in flesh, all sitting next to him on the round table and waiting for their share in the newly founded state. He held nothing but contempt for them, but even being charitable to his past actions, he was honest at least to himself about his own role in enabling the Communists, in their corruption of the young democracy.\n\nPerhaps, all of it could be done differently. The Republic didn't have to surrender to the Communist demands in exchange for the false sense of security. It didn't have to be a welcoming haven for the pitiable scum who found no place for themselves but in Syktyvkar. Whether what could be done, it is much too late. The past was the past. All that mattered was that Voznesensky had to carry his unenviable burden alone, clumsily maneuvering in the web that enveloped Komi.\n\nThe sound of gunfire behind the window helped to sober his reflections. Sighing in response to the habitual barbarity he grew used to a long time ago, Voznesensky took a folder in the bosom and put on his coat. Leaving the residence, he took a long way to his house, to the opposite side of the road where another street fight occurred."
 komiintro.1.a:0 "It is still worth it. It has to be."
 
 komiintro.2.t:0 "The Peacemaker"
 komiintro.2.d:0 "The meeting was mostly going as planned. Alexei Kosygin was discussing various topics with several of the more right-wing members of the democratic coalition. The discussions fo future cabinet positions went fine, with Kosygin mostly satisfied with the various compromises made. He had managed to squeeze in a few more candidates from his own party, the Union of Young Reformers. He discussed upcoming campaign strategies, seeing which districts would have more or less funding from which parties, and working to discuss ways to penetrate some of the more radical districts. However, Kosygin was not surprised when the mention of political radicals derailed the meeting.\n\n'Those communists are going to tear down all of the progress we've made in the name of their so-called 'people's revolution!' Popular my ass, our democratic coalition is the only thing keeping Komi from falling to wanna-be despots!' exclaimed one politician, and it seemed many of those present agreed with him. He continued on, 'And what is Voznesensky doing, huh?! He's cuddling with them! The DSNP are destroying this coalition, and I won't stand for it!' This could get out of hand, a fracture in the coalition could seriously damage their performance in the elections, allowing the radicals to gain power. Kosygin had to do something.\n\n'Friends, colleagues, I understand your fears, truly, I do. I myself am wary of Voznesensky's weak stance towards extremism. However, endangering the coalition's unity is not what the Republic needs, we must instead look at our alternatives,' Kosygin paused briefly, 'Voznesensky has led our Republic for some time, and Komi has grown considerably under his leadership despite the bombings. However, Komi, I feel, may need someone new in charge. Someone who can truly heal Komi of its most infectious disease. Elections are soon, friends, and we stand for democracy, do we not?' Kosygin had been thinking about the elections a lot recently, and the idea of becoming President was becoming more and more seductive. EIther way, it seems his colleagues were pleased by his little speech, and it seems disaster had been averted for now."
 komiintro.2.a:0 "If we wish to see the sun, we must weather the coming storm."

 komiintro.3.t:0 "The Defender"
 komiintro.3.d:0 "Svetlana Stalina looked down at the shuffled papers on her desk, as the lights flickered once more. She barely noticed, instead running a finger along a neatly-written note in one of the margins.\n\n"Future Mayoral Candidate?", it said, next to a grainy photo of a smiling woman.\n\nShe nodded to herself. She would be perfect. Another name went down on the list she was assembling - another person to contact, to fund, and align. One more for the endless lists of personnel that the governing coalition employed to keep the Republic running.\n\nA thought flickered through her mind - an image of her combined proposals for appointments. What a government that would be! Free of radicals and subversives, free of corruption, and dedicated to the Republic over all else. Men and women who knew, above all, that there was a greater good to work towards.\n\nAs she placed the list to the side, and looked absently at the now cold cup of tea that was sitting forgotten on the other side of her desk, she wondered just how her personal path had ended here. Her transformation from the young decadent party-goer that she resented so much, to a dedicated public servant.\n\nIt did not matter, she decided. It was merely a matter for a record, to be consigned to distant memory.\n\nAs always, in personal development and politics, the true important thing to think about was the ends - the now, and the future."
 komiintro.3.a:0 "It will all pay off, someday."

 komiintro.5.t:0 "The Paragon"
 komiintro.5.d:0 "The door swung smoothly to the side as Anatoly crept into the house, slowly letting out a terrified breath. Clutching the pistol at his side, he advanced down the hall, ignoring the quiet chatter of the bodyguards in the other rooms. They wouldn't dare disturb their master while he slept, he hoped, prayed, even. As he reached the last door, a plain, wooden thing, and wrapped his shaking hand around the knob, Anatoly felt a small smile creep onto his face. This was much easier than expected, wasn't it? All he had to do was shoot an old, sleeping man in the head, and it would be done. The Republic would be free of a devil.\n\nAnatoly entered the small bedroom, squinting in the dark as he raised his pistol at the dark mass on the bed -\n\nThe first shot hit Anatoly in the hand. The next in the knee. He squealed in pain as he snapped his gaze towards the darkened corner the shots had come from, nausea rocking his stomach as he met the gaze of his target, sitting comfortably on a leather chair.\n\n"Come now," Mikhail Suslov intoned, barely above a whisper. "Surely you didn't think no one's ever attempted to kill me before?" Anatoly opened his mouth to speak, to jeer the famed shadow master of Komi; all that exited his throat was a whimper. Suslov shook his head. "A shame. Usually Gumilyov's lambs are made of sterner stuff."\n\nHe pulled the trigger again, and Anatoly saw no more.\n\nSuslov stood from his chair, sliding the still-smoking pistol back into his jacket, gaze fixed on his bodyguard as he burst into the room. "Leave him on the steps of the National Assembly. Gumilyov hasn't gotten the message yet, it seems.""
 komiintro.5.a:0 "Perhaps another demonstration is in order."

 komiintro.6.t:0 "The Visionary"
 komiintro.6.d:0 "The winds blew cold through the Komi night, as the shadow tramped through the field. The snow crunched beneath his feet until he reached the ideal spot. The night was clear and silent, perfect for his surreptitious observations. He placed the long case in the field, withdrawing the tripod, deftly expanding it, and attaching the telescope to the top.\n\nHis nighttime adventures were a risk, of course. Suslov had expressed concern for his safety, fearing assassination attempts from the Passionary. But if even Comrade Suslov's men did not know of his excursions, how dangerous could it be?\n\nGlancing into the telescope, Andrei Zhdanov's mind wandered. Far away from the lights of Syktyvkar, that snake pit of intrigue and violence, he found serenity in the gentle movements of the stars. Perhaps out there, lay hope. Other beings who overcame their petty infighting and defeated their worst qualities, an example for humanity to follow into a new age. Freedom from want, freedom from conflict, and freedom from ignorance lay within the grasp of humanity. It was such a shame that it had been squandered for so long, on the petty conflicts of the last decade and the great battle with the backwards, regressive Germany.\n\nBut soon, the time would come. His vision would guide Russia, and the world, into a brave new era. And mankind would be free."
 komiintro.6.a:0 "The way forward lies in our hands."

 komiintro.7.t:0 "The Seeker"
 komiintro.7.d:0 "Svetlana Bukharina smiled cordially for the fifth time at the fifth representative; shook his hand, promised a bright future working together, and stepped away for the fifth time. They never asked her anything about herself, she noticed, only her father. "Your father would be so proud," They'd say, "If only he could see you now," to which she'd smile and agree, promising to follow in dear old Nikolai's footsteps.\n\nShe wasn't so ignorant. This meeting was a productive one, though not for the reasons the rest of the Communist Party thought. It wasn't a mere get-together for her, no, this was a valuable opportunity to learn who the true threats in Komi were, and more importantly, how they could be taken down. The man who had just spoken to her, she noticed with some grim satisfaction, was a coward. The second she'd disagreed with him on a minor dispute, he'd backed down and apologized thoroughly. Someone like that was a follower, not a leader.\n\nSerov had watched her carefully, as expected. A fearsome man, for sure, but he hadn't considered that his prey would be watching him just as carefully. What she took the most interest in was the man's apparent disregard for common Communist theory - the way he spoke reminded Svetlana of what little nazi propaganda she had suffered through in the past.\n\nThe Party was nearing a breaking point, she concluded at the end of the night. Zhdanov and Suslov, for all of their attempts to enforce unity, could not control everyone. Serov would be the first to go, she reasoned, but certainly not the last. A new rising star in the party would be a welcome sight for many, a reassurance that the glory days of the Union were not all lost.\n\nSvetlana Bukharina would be that, but unlike her dear father, she wouldn't let Russia slip through her fingers."
 komiintro.7.a:0 "A new player enters the game."

 komiintro.8.t:0 "The Trailblazer"
 komiintro.8.d:0 "Ivan Serov watched the streets of Komi from his apartment, a frown creasing his face as he watched the sheep mill about below. He hadn't slept well in weeks, and so he had developed this habit of watching the city below, pondering his existence. He was a socialist, he reasoned, always among the most loyal in the entirety of the NKVD, so why did he have so many doubts of late?\n\nHe was always proud of Russia, nationalistically so, even, but surely that was merely because of their former status as a great socialist power? And certainly not in the same way as the Italians, or even the Germans? He shook his head. No, he was better than them, wasn't he?\n\nBut why shouldn't one be devoted to their home above all else? Perhaps the Union wouldn't have fallen if they had fought with the same brutal pride that the Nazis did? Serov felt a churning of doubt within his gut, one that had only intensified over the past weeks. Perhaps he wasn't wrong? Maybe, just maybe, it was Suslov and Zhdanov were misguided about such questions?\n\nMaybe Serov could teach them his new ideas?\n\nA smile crossed his face as he considered, and for the first time in what seemed like years, the churning in his guts lessened. He would lead the Communist Party, and Komi with it, to greatness.\n\nHe stormed to his desk, placed a fresh sheet of paper into his typewriter, and began.\n\nWith this, he would change socialism forever."
 komiintro.8.a:0 "An innovator, or a madman?"

 komiintro.9.t:0 "The Crusader"
 komiintro.9.d:0 "The speaker atop the stage smiled warmly at his audience. They had been so leery, so unreceptive when he was first introduced. Eurasianism had never quite caught on in the Republic of Komi, apart from in his own clique. It wasn't that he or his ideas were an unknown quantity in the Republic - quite the opposite. His infamy was likely the reason that the evening of lectures had been boycotted by Komi's leftists and democrats. And yet, despite everything, he still stood facing a packed theater - one that was conspicuously devoid of hecklers.\n\n"Often," he said, moving into the end of his lecture, "I am thus interrogated: 'Lev Nikolayevich, you call yourself a rightist, yet you advocate against the very things that all true rightists stand for! You do not stand for the church, for the supremacy of Russia, for the glory of the Tsars! What, then, can you possibly offer the people of Russia?'"\n\nThe audience remained silent - but it was a silence of rapt attention. The speaker continued. "People of Syktyvkar, you have heard me speak at length tonight of concepts that I do not expect any of you to grasp: Eurasia, Passionarity, the will to change. You came here expecting to hear an alternative to the corrupt and inefficient democracy imposed upon us. I will confess that I am more comfortable explaining myself through the written word, but for the benefit of those not similarly inclined, allow me to elucidate my message as clearly as I can..."\n\nThe room remained silent, and the speaker knew he had them. "I envision a power to eclipse any that has preceded it. A continent-spanning project wherein the greatest strains of the Motherland's ethnicities are forged into an indivisible whole, capitulating only to the singular authority of the state. Not a weary old empire, where a single ethnos seizes power only to stagnate and fall before a mightier foe, but a supra-national entity - the summation of all that has come before it. It will not merely be the Russians and their strengths, but the Ukrainians, the Kazakhs, the Mongols, the Buryats, and so many more! All of us, inheritors of a combined legacy, standing together under a single banner: the Eurasian State!\n\nAs the audience exploded into applause that was more than merely respectful, someone leaned over to his friend and asked innocently: "Pavel, what was that guy's name again?""
 komiintro.9.a:0 "Gumilyov. Lev Nikolayevich Gumilyov."

 komiintro.10.t:0 "The Organizer"
 komiintro.10.d:0 "Igor Shafarevich looked at the window, as the sun slowly crept into the room, an uninvited intruder. Candlelight spilled over to his drafting table, as its glow lost luster. Shafarevich puffed his lips to blow it out, then stopped. Now was not the time for that. Not when he was approaching completion. He took up his pencil and leaned closer to the drawing board. This particular street was difficult to optimize, and it might be better to remove it entirely. Eraser at hand, he wiped it off the map. Much better.\n\nHe adjusted his glasses, discarding his pencil for a pen. He took a step back, seeing his work in its entirety for the first time since last night. To Shafarevich, it was beautiful. Ordered roads, with its sidewalks and pavements, made precisely to accommodate not only the people of Syktyvkar but also to compensate for its population growth. Everyone in Syktyvkar could get from one point to another in less than an hour's travel time. He put the tip of his pen onto the drawing board.\n\nOthers in the National Assembly had mocked him before. The lines on two streets intersected. He reached out to his eraser, finding it in his pocket after a few moments of frantic searching. He erased the obstacle, rearranging them to bear each other's weight, one incoming, one oncoming. This proposal might not get anywhere, considering the political nature of the Republic, but the work was its own reward. Now onto this sidewalk, and unto this pavement, as he drew in his lines and dotted in points along with them: streetlights.\n\nAll of this done, Shafarevich decided to test his creation. The walk from his home to the National Assembly was fifteen minutes. He picked up his pencil again, tracing it along the new route. In his head, his mind ticked. Two meters a second, average walking speed. Nine, ten. Ten minutes! Now for the next step. Much property destruction would be involved in the realization of this plan, and he laid the original design on top of his. Taking out his notebook, he began to count."
 komiintro.10.a:0 "Sufficient measures..."
 
 komiintro.11.t:0 "섭정"
 komiintro.11.d:0 "삐걱거리는 낡은 교회 사이로 찬바람이 불어 제단 위에 높이 세워진 테오토코스의 얼굴을 가로질러 촛불을 춤을 추게 했습니다. 그녀와 그 아이의 눈은 그들 앞에 무릎을 꿇고 있는 간청자를 내려다보았고, 그의 입술은 끊임없이 조용한 기도로 움직였습니다.\n\n"오 천왕이시여, 위안자시여, 진리의 정령이시여, 어디서나 예술을 하고 만물을 가득 채우시는 분, 축복의 보물과 생명을 주시는 자께서 우리 안에 와서 지키시며, 모든 불순함에서 우리를 깨끗하게 하시고, 우리의 영혼을 구원하소서, 오 선한 자시여."\n\n세르게이 타보리츠키는 추위가 그를 휩쓸고 지나가자 잠시 멈추고 몸을 부르르 떨었습니다. 그 추위가 그의 오래된 뼈에 오싹함을 보냈습니다. "하느님 맙소사! 신이시여! 거룩하신 불사신이시여! 우리에게 자비를 베풀어 주시옵소서. 하느님 맙소사! 신이시여! 거룩하신 불사신이시여! 우리에게 자비를 베풀어 주시옵소서. 하느님 맙소사! 신이시여! 거룩하신 불사신이시여! 우리에게 자비를 베풀어 주시옵소서..."\n\n추위가 밀려들어 그가 입고 있던 낡은 왕당파 제복을 뚫었습니다. 그것의 금빛 깃은 그의 목에 얼어붙은 쇠로 된 수갑처럼 느껴졌고, 고운 비단 안감은 겨울의 추위로부터 그를 보호해 주는데 아무런 도움이 되지 않았습니다. 그는 얼굴을 찡그리며 이를 악물고 눈을 떴고, 고개를 들어 성모의 눈을 정면으로 응시했습니다. 이에 그는 자신의 몸속에서 추위를 몰아내면서 다시 신앙의 불꽃이 자신의 내면에 생명에 굉음을 내는 것을 느꼈습니다. 그는 갑작스러운 더위에 숨을 헐떡였지만, 완전히 가만히 있었습니다. 그의 뒤에는 안심이 되는 두 손이 어깨 위에 얹혀져 있었고, 귓속말로 부드럽게 속삭이고 있었습니다. 그의 눈에 습기가 몰려들었고, 그는 그것이 무엇인지에 대한 익숙한 감각을 인식하며 다시 눈을 감았습니다.\n\n"오 주여, 그를 안전하게 지켜주소서" 하고 그가 있는 자리에서 직접 말하였습니다. "우리의 축복받은 군주를 지켜주소서. 때가 되면 황태자를 우리에게 돌려주소서. 내 신성한 임무를 수행할 힘을 주소서. 당신의 적을 물리치고, 이 땅을 원래대로 되돌릴 힘을 주소서. 오 주여 간청합니다. 주님, 나와 함께 서서, 내가 신성한 러시아를 구원할 수 있도록 도와 주십시오.""
 komiintro.11.a:0 "신께서 러시아를 보우하시기를."

 NIK.1.t:0 "A Free Agent"
 NIK.1.d:0 "Glorious people of the Komi Republic, the time for movement is now! In this world, and even in this Republic, the boot of so-called revolutionary action haunts the people with their lies. They are in our homes, our streets, and they are ready to take action. We must move first, for this Republic must not falter."\n\nConcluding her speech, silence fills the room for but a brief moment before thunderous applause reaches her ears. It seems her message has gotten through.\n\nSvetlana Stalina, a devoted new politician, has quite quickly climbed the byzantine ladder of influence in the Komi Republic, and her messages of anti-revolutionary zeal and revenge against the German menace that plagues the fields of Russia has resonated with at least a sizable portion of the masses. Now, she has become a major political asset in the ever-so complicated political field of Komi, and even opponents of her have come to concede it."
 NIK.1.a:0 "A most magnificent showing."
 NIK.1.b:0 "I sense a darkness within her..."

 NIK.2.t:0 "Stalina Advocates for Stronger Measures"
 NIK.2.d:0 "My fellow Deputies, the enemies of our republic lie around us. They lurk in the darkness, awaiting their opportunity to strike at our foundations and collapse the structure that has held this nation together. We cannot wait! We cannot wait for them to enact this evil plan! We must make the first move - and battle them through any means necessary."\n\nAlthough the sounds of applause filled the chamber almost immediately from Stalina's portion, hushed whispers and glances dominate the rest of the group. The measures Svetlana puts forward are extensive, and involve different varieties of actions against 'enemies of Komi', such as further powers of the ruling party of the legislative chamber, the ability to carry out arrests without warrant of said enemies, and some rumor that, outside of the legal powers, Svetlana will further fund her allied paramilitaries in order to help control the nation. Whether that is true or not, however, does not matter. Svetlana has already made her move."
 NIK.2.a:0 "Could it be necessary?"

 NIK.3.t:0 "Disorder from the Left?"
 NIK.3.d:0 "A malaise hangs in the air for the leftist bloc. Since Stalina's proclamation of destruction of the enemies of Komi, activity has become different than usual. Impromptu, emergency meetings between legislators and paramilitary members. The politicians move unlike anyone has seen them before - with haste and alarm. The meetings, too, show a great change in mood: the whispers grow in number, the applause grows less certain, the glances become only more and more worried.\n\nThe leftist paramilitaries, too, show bizarre behavior. Their movements are further mixed up, the graffiti on walls becoming less and less prevalent, and the members themselves encrypting their communications however they can. The presence of trouble is in the atmosphere - and the reasoning is not difficult."
 NIK.3.a:0 "The cracks show."

 NIK.4.t:0 "Kosygin Endorses Stalina's Plan"
 NIK.4.d:0 "The legislation chamber was tense. Stalina's measures had generated plenty of unease within the lawmakers, and all in the room awaited the next person to speak, hoping for some sort of resolution or agreement - anything to break the mold. The next person to speak, the economical genius Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin, highly respected within the democratic Deputies, only intensified the feeling of tenseness.\n\n"Friends and gentlemen, action is necessary. Miss Stalina's plan is necessary. We cannot let the enemies of our beautiful republic destroy our resolve, nor can we let them extinguish our flame. For the security of our democracy, this must happen. Miss Stalina, in fact, should become a critical asset to the party in this matter, and we should all appreciate her guidance as well as her plan of action."\n\nAlthough there was a decent amount of applause, especially from those allied to Kosygin, other members, specifically Voznesensky's wing, were more doubtful. After all, wasn't Stalina with them?"
 NIK.4.a:0 "Let them associate freely."
 NIK.4.b:0 "Could this be a violation of party unity?"

 NIK.5.t:0 "A Pact in Secret"
 NIK.5.d:0 "Following Kosygin's speech, the legislation chamber took a five minute rest and discussion period. To the followers of Voznesensky, however, it seemed like Russia would be reunified before the break would be finished. Discussions in hushed tones dominated all sections of the chamber, but nowhere did it happen more than in Voznesensky's section. As the break reached its end, Voznesensky rose up from his seat and made his way to the podium.\n\n"Kosygin, your plan of action in this chamber do not help us, the party, or the Republic. What you are suggesting is only dividing us further, and constitutes as creating your own alliance with Miss Stalina. I officially condemn your statements. That is all."\n\nWhile some applause rang out, the majority of the Deputies reacted in silence.\n\nAs dusk approached and the session wrapped up, Stalina and Kosygin stayed behind in the room. Their words few, but their motivations plenty, it was agreed on with a simple handshake. An alliance to protect each other, and to serve the republic - through whatever means necessary."
 NIK.5.a:0 "Let's hope it isn't needed."

 NIK.6.t:0 "Unity, for Now"
 NIK.6.d:0 "After the session and Kosygin's controversial speech, two stayed behind in the legislative chamber. The two most influential democrats, the economical masterminds of Komi, the fire and saviours of the Republic must meet.\n\nAlthough the purpose was a brief negotiation, both men proceeded to lose track of time. By the time they finished, it was already near-midnight. However, following a final, genuine handshake, the negotiations were complete. In exchange for Kosygin retracting his statements, Voznesensky would, at a later point in time, send through measures that were more effective. Both men came out of the meeting satisfied, as their party would remain strong - strong enough to withstand any coming political storm."
 NIK.6.a:0 "We must stand together!"

 NIK.7.t:0 "The Thorn in Our Eye"
 NIK.7.d:0 "Voznesensky shifted his gaze around. It was another meeting of the Voznesentsi, and it was a centrist politician's turn to speak. As he spoke, Voznesensky became interested, and as the wheels in his head turned and turned, became perturbed. Although the politician's words were not important, his affiliation was. His mind raced, and his eyes began to take on a knowing glow. One name appeared in his consciousness, again and again.\n\nZhdanov.\n\nIt was a secret. For now. Confined only to a group of a few people. But if it ever got out - Voznesensky shuddered. Just imagining Kosygin's reaction was enough. Then again, Zhdanov was an immeasurably precious asset to him, and if he needed his help, he would get dead air in response.\n\nThe politician finished his words. But he was not focused on the next generic speaker. Voznesensky had to choose..."
 NIK.7.a:0 "Speaking to him was a mistake in the first place."
 NIK.7.b:0 "He is too valuable to cut ties with."

 NIK.8.t:0 "Cutting Ties"
 NIK.8.d:0 "As Voznesensky penned "Sincerely, Nikolai Voznesensky"to his paper, he let out a sigh of relief. The weight of his burden would forever be lifted, and he could rest. No more connections, no more ties, no more association. Voznesensky would be free.\n\nCalling a trusted courier into his office, he ordered the young man to send the letter straight away - his purpose would be official state business, and the contents classified. He placed faith in the deliverer to complete his task timely - for Voznesensky did not know how long these ties could last before being thrust, in an intrusive display, to the unaware public.\n\nThe young courier nodded his head at the command, and was dismissed straight away. His duties were evident to both men, and it was best for him to start accomplishing it. As he left, Voznesensky smiled. Relaxed now, he sat back into his chair and muttered."
 NIK.8.a:0 "Severance, at last."

 NIK.9.t:0 "Our Connections Leaked!"
 NIK.9.d:0 "A crisis has engulfed Komi! Although this headline is not a new one, the details of this particular story have interested both the public and the politicians alike.\n\nAn unknown 'associate' of Nikolai Voznesensky has come forward with damaging information about him - in particular, his connections with a certain radical socialist named Andrei Zhdanov. The leaked documents detail the extent of the connections, highlighting the relationship between Zhdanov and Voznesensky and showing the amount of collaboration.\n\nThe Voznesentsi has been completely shattered by the news, as highly tempered debates run wild in the meeting minutes and legislative sessions following the story being broken. Voznesensky now must face the consequences of his actions, and has already come to a solution regarding how this mess will be handled."
 NIK.9.a:0 "Honesty is the best policy."
 NIK.9.b:0 "This never happened."

 NIK.10.t:0 "Admitting Fault"
 NIK.10.d:0 "Friends of the party and of the Republic. I am aware that you all now know of the allegations regarding my ties to Zhdanov. I must say, with complete truth, that these ties have existed, and-"\n\nShocked exclamations and murmurs filled the chamber as the depths of the situation sunk in to the politicians in attendance. For a solid minute, anarchy ruled over the chamber as arguments began over Voznesenky's true loyalty, only ending when the head of the session declared order be held in the assembly.\n\n"These ties have existed, yes. But these ties are now cut. And they will remain cut for good. My loyalty is not to Zhdanov, but to this Republic we preside over. I implore you all to consider this. Thank you."\n\nThe politicians look over at him, all eyes boring down upon Voznesenky. The fate of his leadership relies on them. And now, they must vote on it."
 NIK.10.a:0 "The Party will decide your fate."
 NIK.10.b:0 "The Party will decide your fate."

 NIK.11.t:0 "Finding Forgiveness"
 NIK.11.d:0 "Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky, the voting will now begin. Take your seat."\n\nAnticipation rocked the air as the first hands went up to mark him innocent. After taking the census, the hands now went up to mark him in contempt. Somewhere in Voznesensky's eyes, a glitter showed up.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky, the votes have been counted... by a margin of one hundred and twenty two to seventy eight, you have been found absolved of any crime revealed by these documents presented before us."Voznesensky couldn't help but crack a smile. A closer margin than he would have liked? Sure. Yet, despite the turmoil, he was free."
 NIK.11.a:0 "Lenient, perhaps."

 NIK.12.t:0 "There will be no Forgiveness"
 NIK.12.d:0 "Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky, the voting will now begin. Take your seat."\n\nThe result was quick to arrive. By a margin of one hundred and sixty to forty, Voznesenky was found guilty of his crimes against the Republic of Komi, and will be held in contempt of the legislation chamber. Voznesensky's expression was neutral throughout the vote, revealing nothing of his inner mind or plans. But his expression did not matter anymore. His fate has been sealed, for the talks of removing Voznesensky from power have already begun in the room - and they show no signs of letting up."
 NIK.12.a:0 "No peace. No respite. No mercy."

 NIK.13.t:0 "Covering the Evidence"
 NIK.13.d:0 "The sounds of whitewashing broadcasted itself to an almost empty woods. As the shovel dug on, and the briefcase stood firm in the slight moonlight breeze, the man couldn't help think of the circumstances that led to this point. He had obtained the documents, yes - he sent loyal assistants to take care of that. Without anyone knowing, he had slipped out of Syktyvkar during the dead of night, indeed - he arranged it on an official 'private outing' for the next few days, and he thought, at least, no one suspected the wiser.\n\nThe waxing gibbous and a flashlight was the only sources reflecting on his face, yet on his soul reflected much. But his resolve was clear. He must not let this come to light. Otherwise, too much would be at stake. It was for the good of the Republic, he imagined, as the shovel did the last shoveling of its dirt."
 NIK.13.a:0 "Bury it deep."

 NIK.14.t:0 "A Leak into a Downpour"
 NIK.14.d:0 "Voznesensky placed his head down on his desk. An unfortunate courier had delivered news of another set of documents revealed to the public. Not the first time the news was brought to him, Voznesensky simply sighed and dismissed the messenger, muttering a curse word to him under his breath.\n\nEver since the evidence was disposed of, the Republic, and the Voznesentsi in particular, have been wracked by yet another political crisis. This one, however, struck the party nerve to the limit. The anonymous source has not slumbered, as new documents and evidence are leaked daily to the Party and the public. Suspicious of Voznesensky due to him not testifying and seeing less of a necessity politicians loyal to him grow fewer by the day.\n\nIn addition to this, rumours have surfaced of even further ties to Zhdanov, to the point where both men would be comfortable with each other in a meeting, swapping jokes as a socialist revolution is plotted. While these are only rumors, they have still dented the reputation of the party, and threaten to destroy entirely the relative internal peace within the legislation chamber."
 NIK.14.a:0 "Could it be unstoppable?"

 NIK.15.t:0 "Hunting the Source"
 NIK.15.d:0 "Gentlemen and ladies of the party. The accusations that befall me are quite obviously untrue. Yet despite this, these rumors continue to flow, and damage our wonderful republic. Due to this...\n\n"This man is a traitor!" outbursts a Deputy, and the entire chamber erupts into chaos. The evident loss of trust in Voznesensky within some sectors of the party continues to manifest itself, until a screech drowns out the arguments and brings order once again to the room.\n\nHolding his microphone, Voznesensky continues. "Now. These rumors are false, yet they damage us. We cannot allow the source of these rumors to continue shrouded in darkness. An investigative committee must, and will be formed. This investigation will encompass any suspected spreader of these rumors. Whoever it is, we will find them, and justice will be served."\n\nThe members, coincidentally Voznesenky's most trusted advisors, have already been selected, and the investigation now begins."
 NIK.15.a:0 "Come out, come out..."

 NIK.16.t:0 "The Party Compromised!"
 NIK.16.d:0 "Voznesensky and his investigative committee glanced at each other with suspense. Progress has been minimal so far into the investigation, and no leads produced conclusive results.\n\nThe tension was shattered with the bursting of a door, and the rushing of a committee member into the room. "The damned Soviet bastards! They're watching us!"\n\nThrough an informant with more loyalty to Voznesensky than previously thought, a sweeping revelation came to the attention of the committee: the party - specifically, Voznesensky's own wing of the party - had been infiltrated by spies. Further questioning revealed that these spies were under the command of none other than Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, suspected leader of the many socialist and communist parties and paramilitaries in the Komi Republic.\n\nAfter being told the news, Voznesensky mirrored the faces of the rest of the committee: near-panic. A decision had to be made quickly in order for the agents not to find out - crack immediately down on them, or wait and see what to do next?"
 NIK.16.a:0 "Drop the hammer!"
 NIK.16.b:0 "There will be no hasty moves."

 NIK.17.t:0 "The Democrats' Purge"
 NIK.17.d:0 "The vote is passed. The expulsion of these agents will begin in due process, with no exceptions."\n\nMany members of the democratic party began to sweat. The purge of suspected "agents working for Suslov"began shortly after, with police storming into the legislative chamber and beginning to arrest previously suspected agents. While some offered resistance and admitted themselves, most kept quiet, regardless of their true affiliation.\n\nAfter the arrests were made, Voznesensky made his way to the podium. "Friends of Komi, we can no longer tolerate foreign agents, spies, and traitors in our ranks. This is not the end. More of Suslov's spies are watching us right now. Any so-called Voznesentsi of mine will be subject to further investigation to ensure they are truly loyal to the republic. That is all. You are all dismissed early for the day. Remember where your loyalties should lie.""
 NIK.17.a:0 "How many could there be?"

 NIK.18.t:0 "Svetlana Urges Caution"
 NIK.18.d:0 "After the events of the previous session, the democratic Deputies have turned to a state of hysteria. Accusations fly like never before, hostility is growing, and all worry about the ties and bonds of even of the person sitting right next to them. The loss of unity in the party troubled Svetlana Stalina, and not articulating her own thoughts on the situation would be a grave mistake for the party. After a politician's speech on "destroying the Suslov agents", Stalina took her turn to speak.\n\n"Distinguished Comrades. The situation that has developed in this room does not play to our advantage in the slightest. Instead of questioning the circumstances that led to the documents being leaked, you all assume that the leaker is somewhere in this room, right now. I beg of you to consider this alternate option: the leaker, as he is called, has not, in fact, leaked anything. Rather, it is an organized plan by our enemies - a plan to destabilize our precious democracy by framing someone who has not done anything wrong with crimes against the state. I should know this, because that's what I would do."\n\nLoud mutters filled the chamber at this point, with eyes glanced on Stalina in a worrying fashion. "I believe that this could be a conspiracy, a conspiracy that will send us crashing down in flames. Please, think about it."\n\nThe murmurings in the chamber eventually cease, and some token applause is offered. More, however, are worried on the issue of Stalina admitting that this would be something she would do. Many decide not to think about that."
 NIK.18.a:0 "Ironic."

 NIK.19.t:0 "A Plot!"
 NIK.19.d:0 "The committee members were sure of it. Right there lied the evidence, the proof needed to end this debacle once and for all. A Voznesentsi politician by the name of Nikita Yakovich has been accused of orchestrating the release of documents to the public, as well as spreading rumors that damaged the reputation of Voznesensky himself. Confident in their work and relieved that this emergency may finally come to an end, all but one headed out to begin the proceedings.\n\nHis original purpose was to take one last look at the documents, to oversee his vision for the case: start to finish, the evidence complete. But as he glanced over the document, a detail caught his eye. Didn't it say Yakovich and Zhdanov meet in Yb, where no one would notice yesterday? But this interview here with Yakovich's secretary said he was in the office the whole day. And this detail here is incorrect... and that one... and...\n\nThe committee member widened his eyes. In their haste, they had made basic errors in finding the leaker. The evidence that did implicate him was planted - a set-up. Rushing out of the door, forgetting his hat, he desperately went out of the room and into the night, hopeful to find any way to halt the proceedings... before an innocent man is punished for a crime he did not commit."
 NIK.19.a:0 "Can we stop it in time?"

 NIK.20.t:0 "A Smoking Gun"
 NIK.20.d:0 "Nikita Yakovich, your attention. Deputies, to attention."\n\nWhen the news spread that the leaker that had caused much tension and damage to the democratic coalition had been found, the politicians lit their torches. Following a midnight raid by police on Yakovich's home, seizing him in a state of sleep and reading to him his charges in a courtroom, he was personally sent on Voznesensky's orders to the legislative chamber in order to assure his party that all was well, and that the troubles would be over.\n\nAs Nikita repeatedly pleaded his innocence, to no avail, Voznesensky pointed to the trembling man. "This man - a traitor of the republic and a spy for Suslov - is the man that has caused us great suffering in our legitimacy and in our Komi! Shame onto this man, for he is the leaker - and the evidence has been gathered to prove it!"\n\nAt an undisclosed location, an advisor speaks to one Mikhail Suslov on the news. A slight grin creeps onto his face, his eyes alight with the feeling of yet another pawn moving forward. "Excellent."\n\nVoznesensky took stock of the situation in front of him. He had already privately dismissed the charges against him in court. No, no, the court would not do. He would deal with him personally. But in which way?"
 NIK.20.a:0 "Expelling him will be sufficient."
 NIK.20.b:0 "Call Yuri. Send a message to the rest."

 NIK.21.t:0 "Blackmailing the Problem"
 NIK.21.d:0 "Nikita Yakovich had enough common sense to realize something was amiss. His trial was dismissed. While the police were always nearby, they did not take action against him. While the politicians jeered and glared at him, he was still allowed to conduct limited political duties. It did not click, however, until the night of his retirement.\n\nThe chorus of glances, whispers, and outbursts declaring him an enemy of Komi that had been the drawl of a legislative session had concluded. He was tired and miserable, like the days before, ever since he had been accused of crimes against the state. Arriving at his home, relieved that it had not been destroyed by a German bomb yet, he sat down on his living room chair and lit the fireplace.\n\nA knock on the door interrupted his thoughts. Opening it, he was surprised by the man standing before him: Nikolai Voznesensky himself. "I have come to have a talk with you, Nikita."With no other choice but to invite his guest inside, Yakovich gestured towards him to take a seat beside him at the fireplace. Both men sitting, Voznesenky went straight to the point.\n\n"Quite clearly, Yakovich, your crimes against the state have been appalling to the rest of us. And it would be a shame if something were to further ruin your reputation. Like these pictures, for example..."Yakovich's skin turned a pale white. How did he get those...? "The way I see it, Nikita, you have two options. The first is the merciful one. You will resign from your post as Deputy at once. Or... you can tell your wife-"Yakovich capitulated, agreeing to his demands. The political career of Nikita Yakovich was now over."
 NIK.21.a:0 "Just what he deserves."

 NIK.22.t:0 "Nikita Yakovich Found Dead!"
 NIK.22.d:0 "The Deputy sat in front of his fireplace. His tea boiled, and his watch read half past eight. Looking around, a figure stood in front of him-\n\nA flash. A bang. A thud. Nikita Yakovich went dead silent.\n\nNews from Syktyvkar today, as alleged leaker of damaging documents related to Voznesensky has been found shot dead inside of his home. The Deputy's watch was reported to have stopped around dusk, and according to the autopsy, appeared to have died immediately from two bullet wounds, one to the head and the other to the heart. However, despite the gruesome shooting leaving a mark on the public consciousness, there is still no evidence of the identity of the killer, nor if there was a motivation behind it. It seems another senseless killing has plagued our republic...\n\nVoznesensky laughed at the news report. Yuri had done his job well, as expected. His immediate payment would include a bonus, even! He was feeling generous today. The leaker is dead. And that is what mattered."
 NIK.22.a:0 "He will not be missed."

 NIK.23.t:0 "The Innocent Verdict"
 NIK.23.d:0 "He wasn't there that Thursday, Nikolai. That's the only thing that needs to be said and our whole structure of power could come tumbling down."\n\nThere were very few times in his life that Voznesensky had been genuinely shocked. Not since the fall of the Union has a realization hit such a poignant note in the politician. This man was innocent. Free of crime. No evidence that holds up. And he had put him out of his job.\n\nNews today reports that the murdered politician, Nikita Yakovich, alleged to be the leaker of state and personal documents, has been declared innocent of all charges. Already, protests have begun to be dispersed by Voznesensky-aligned paramilitaries, and the legislation is determining on their next course of action.\n\nVoznesensky was at a crossroads. He had to do something. But what?"
 NIK.23.a:0 "An innocent on our conscience."
 NIK.23.b:0 "Retract the story!"

 NIK.24.t:0 "Voznesensky, in the Presidium, with the Hit Squad!"
 NIK.24.d:0 "A verdict has been reached in the death of one of our former delegates, and the man who gave the order to have him killed.\n\nFar from what we originally expected, Yakovich was innocent, a victim of one of Suslov's plots to tear down our coalition. Our own Voznesensky, however, had plenty of warning to the contrary. Both Alexei Kosygin and Svetlana Stalina have testified against him in our own internal court, stating that he had ample warning that Yakovich was innocent, and the evidence didn't quite line up. Despite this, he went on with the kill order anyway, and had Yakovich buried in a shallow grave.\n\nThe internal opinion of the Party has shifted radically away from the disgraced Voznesensky, and closer to the ascendant Kosygin and Stalina - the right-center coalition containing our most experienced, and most importantly, less rampant, politicians.\n\nFar from standard procedure, this is an act of murder, and one that sets a dangerous precedent. His penalty shall be a vote of no confidence, and, if cast down from his chair, full legal processing at the hands of his replacement."
 NIK.24.a:0 "You should have listened, Nikolai."

 NIK.25.t:0 "The Vote of No Confidence"
 NIK.25.d:0 "Voznesensky stood before the podium. One hundred and ninety nine faces looked upon him, some with mixed feelings, most others with hatred in their eyes.\n\n"Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky. You have been charged, with substantial evidence, of high crimes against one Nikita Yakovich, and against the Republic of Komi. As a result, a vote of no confidence will be levied against you, and a replacement shall be nominated if the vote passes."\n\nVoznesensky started to become drenched with sweat. He had rolled the dice, and he had gotten snake eyes. The question of his survival as leader now was ever-so-present within the nation and the National Assembly. Would he last?"
 NIK.25.a:0 "Out with the old?"

 NIK.26.t:0 "Deprecated"
 NIK.26.d:0 "Voznesensky looked down at his feet. The vote for confidence in him was about to begin, and as he reflected upon himself, he still believed that his policies were still best for the nation. He hoped that they would understand that.\n\n"By a vote of one hundred and sixteen to eighty-four, the National Assembly has declared that you are in no confidence to lead this assembly any longer, Nikolai Voznesensky. Now we begin the process of voting for your replacement. Good day. Take him away, guards."\n\nIn a surprise turn of events, an unexpected candidate, Alexander Belozerov, has been voted in as President! A conservative politician, Belozerov was never the type of person to be cast into the spotlight, instead diligently representing the small center-right wing of his party. However, a combination of previous Voznesensky supporters, having more in number than expected during the no confidence vote, deciding to vote for Belozerov out of dislike of either Kosygin or Stalina, as well as the Stalina and Kosygin blocs devolving into fighting between each other, thus making them unable to unite behind a single leader.\n\nWhile Belozerov, in his acceptance speech, claims he will unite the republic and bring order to the congress, many Deputies, even those within his own wing, see him as an ineffective choice for President, and such a President may even allow for something as drastic as the fall of democracy in Komi..."
 NIK.26.a:0 "A new name to learn..."

 NIK.27.t:0 "Kosygin Inaugurated as President!"
 NIK.27.d:0 "Voznesensky gazed at the ceiling, not even bothering to see the expressions of his comrades. Did it matter who supported him at this point? What was the point if everything he worked for was ruined? All he could do is await his verdict.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky. By a vote of one hundred and sixty-nine to thirty-one, you have been removed from office effective immediately. Security will now escort you out. Have a good day, sir. The voting for your replacement will now begin."\n\nThe choice for President has been decided: Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin, a well-known economic mastermind and representative of his liberal wing of the democratic party, accepted his new post today as the President of the Republic of Komi. Vowing to steer the republic without influence of the more radical ideologies inside of it, his experience and age has made him an ideal pick for those seeking stability and democracy after Voznesensky's fall from grace. While he is slightly more right-wing than Voznesensky, his desire to keep the flame of democracy alive in Komi still beats. The legislation has reacted rather favorably to the news, with plenty of applause being present during and after his acceptance speech. It seems a new dawn of democracy has shined on the Republic of Komi."
 NIK.27.a:0 "A change for the better?"

 NIK.28.t:0 "Stalina Inaugurated as President!"
 NIK.28.d:0 "Voznesensky wore the scowl on his face proudly. How dare those traitors throw him to that horde of angry politicians? After all he did for this glorious republic. They should all be ashamed of themselves, and this republic will fall to the ground because of them.\n\n"The hands that call for his removal are... one hundred and forty-three... the hands that oppose are fifty-seven. Voznesensky, by the voting of this National Assembly, the government of the Republic has expressed no confidence in your leadership. Your replacement will be voted on now. Security, escort this man out."\n\nIt is official: Svetlana Stalina has been made President of the Republic of Komi. Managing an upset victory, her acceptance speech pledged that any threats to the order of the Republic would be annihilated, and that democracy shall flourish under her watchful eye. While most of the chamber reacted to her speech with cheers and applause, very strangely, some of the Deputies with closer ties to Stalina were reported to have looks of worry on their face. Whatever the reaction is, however, there is no doubt about it - the Republic has a new leader, ready to steer the country to greatness."
 NIK.28.a:0 "Let's see how she does."
 
 NIK.2800.t:0 "Voznesensky Endures!"
 NIK.2800.d:0 "Voznesensky, stoic, gazes blankly at the roof of the chamber. Here was a man disgraced by his own comrades. Here was a man who had lost his sense of morality. Here was Nikolai Voznesensky, leader of democracy in Komi - but, perhaps, not for much longer. The party will decide his fate.\n\n"The time has now come to vote on confidence in comrade Voznesensky's leadership. If you are in favor of comrade Voznesensky, please raise your hand now."As the hands were raised, some politicians glanced at each other. Whispers broke out within the legislative groups, and worried looks appeared on faces throughout the room. Voznesensky perked up, his eyes narrowed and his heart pounding.\n\nMore amount of hands were showing than he thought. Perhaps even half of the chamber!\n\n"And... if you are in favor of removing comrade Voznesensky from his position of power, raise your hands."The Deputy in charge of counting was perplexed. The margin was very narrow, but it seems no one voted twice... and democracy was democracy.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky... by a vote of one hundred and three to ninety-seven, you have been declared still fit to hold this position of office..."Uproar immediately broke out throughout the chamber, only silenced by the incessant banging of the gavel. Voznesensky felt weak. Somehow... he was still the President. Even though by a thread, loyalty and confidence in him was still present. Nikolai resolved himself. His job was to lead the Republic. And so, he will."
 NIK.2800.a:0 "How does he survive?"

 NIK.29.t:0 "Discrediting the Leakers"
 NIK.29.d:0 "Overwhelming firepower. That's how we'll destroy these leaks. If the damned Germans were able to destroy the Union with it, I'd say it would work well here."\n\nThe meeting continued on after that suggestion, but it seemed no other idea resonated as greatly. The leaks had damaged the democratic party's reputation, and fast solutions were needed in order to try to stop the ship from completely sinking. A giant media blitz is proposed as the answer - the propaganda machine will never stop turning, and it must not stop - otherwise, the leaks may doom our chances of survival.\n\nEach and every leak will be analyzed and discredited, providing some sort of evidence that the document contains falsities and lies. And so, we shall churn out our great campaign - to defend democracy. Of course, some may say that all these fact-checks are untrue, even within our own party... but these naysayers wouldn't want their own files to be left out of the analyzation process, after all. All will be in agreement."
 NIK.29.a:0 "Truth? It does not matter."

 NIK.30.t:0 "The Party Fades"
 NIK.30.d:0 "The analyst looked, and looked again. No matter how many times he analyzed the figures, success was simply not there. The discrediting process was supposed to work, wasn't it? They said this was a bright idea... and yet these numbers say otherwise. Should he burst the bubble? He thought about it a bit. Despite his fearfulness of consequences, he figured that the party deserves to know the truth - no matter what it says. He called his supervisor over and showed him the paper.\n\n"We have a problem. This poll given to us by an analyst shows our support is dropping. Not by a lot, mind you, but still enough to be concerning. I've already fired him, of course, but it is still something we have to pay attention to."The meeting attendants looked at each other with an amount of worry. Voznesensky, the chair of the meeting, responded back."These numbers do not show anything significant. It is indeed a temporary setback, but it's not like the Germans are invading Syktyvkar. We will debate how to fix this - if you all believe that it needs to be fixed - in a legislative debate tomorrow. Meeting adjourned. Stop wasting my time with this crap.""
 NIK.30.a:0 "A small price to pay."

 NIK.31.t:0 "The Popularity Debate"
 NIK.31.d:0 "As the gavel banged and the session began, all eyes shifted to the candidates selected for debating the course of action on the declining poll numbers, and what to do to fix them. With each party in the coalition all holding their own positions on what to do in this situation, the debate was guaranteed to be a long and intense one. Each candidate, as per debate custom in the chamber, was asked to begin with an opening statement describing what they would do to fix the declining support of the democratic party among the people.\n\n"The fact that we are having this debate at all is a sign that the party has become full of worriers and defeatists," the social-democratic candidate begins. "Numbers like these go up and down all the time. One dip does not mean we must make a crisis out of it. Next person, please."\n\n"Democracy is a fragile beast." Kosygin comments. "It is constantly under siege from those who wish to destroy it. Radicalism is the enemy of our republic, and only God may know what these radicals will do if they are granted access to our leadership positions. We must not allow concessions to these fascists and communists in order to preserve our homeland from hatred and authoritarianism. That's all."\n\nIt took barely a second for Stalina to reply in kind, staring down at the audience. "Thank you. Kosygin is correct that we must safeguard ourselves against the radicals. However, not all of the radicals are unshakable in their beliefs. I believe that if we speak to the more democratic socialists, for example, and the less authoritarian rightists, we may be able to draw them into support for democracy, and thus, our numbers go up. My statement is done."\n\nAs the figures began their debate, the observers watched with interest, some taking notes. However, they could only choose one winner of the debate. They believed that..."
 NIK.31.a:0 "Voznesensky is correct."
 NIK.31.b:0 "Kosygin has the best argument."
 NIK.31.e:0 "Stalina presents the optimal solution."

 NIK.32.t:0 "The Voznesentsi's Solution"
 NIK.32.d:0 "As the debate concluded and the regular - albeit mandatory - applause filled the room, the democratic delegates were asked to select a 'winner' of the debate on slipping popularity numbers.\n\n"Comrades of this assembly. Now is the time to count these votes, and determine the actions of this party in regards to the numbers crisis."\n\n"By a margin of thirty-five, Comrade Voznesensky's plan...""Or rather, the lack of one,"he muttered under his breath, "...has been passed."\n\nVoznesensky's ideas were simple. If there is no action needed, there is no problem. Polls are simply that: polls. The numbers will always move back and forth, and there is no reason to assume that this will change. If the nature of the polls do not change, then there is no reason to change anything. And after all, if there is no action needed, there is no problem. Democracy would go on, and Komi would be blessed by the continued rule of the democratic party. All from not overreacting to one stupid poll."
 NIK.32.a:0 "Let's hope it works."

 NIK.33.t:0 "Soyuz Molodih Reformatorov's Solution"
 NIK.33.d:0 "The applause echoed across the chamber. The debate had concluded, and now, the delegates had to make their choice on the course that the party must take to combat falling poll numbers."Comrades of Komi, the voting process for the winner of these debates begins now. Please cast your votes."\n\n"By a margin of forty-seven, Comrade Kosygin's plan has been passed."\n\nKosygin is a man who was determined to defend democracy. In his view, Komi can only be saved if the enemies of democracy were to be struck down before the radicals could strike and destroy the foundation of the republic. Anti-radical measures will be passed, further democratic-oriented "citizen's informational media"will be published and spread, and certain orders will be given to paramilitaries in order to secure the democratic control of republican-aligned districts. Each and every method needed to safeguard democracy will be applied, with full effort and full power behind it. And the republic would be saved."
 NIK.33.a:0 "Let's hope it works."

 NIK.34.t:0 "Demokraticheskiy Vybor Rossii's Solution"
 NIK.34.d:0 "Following the debate and usual applause that came with its end, the delegates were asked to vote on the 'winner' of the debate, and in turn, decide the plan that would end the falling popularity of the democratic party.\n\n"Delegates of this dear republic, it is now time to begin our voting for this debate's winner. Decide and cast your vote now..."\n\nThe delegate's inflection was one of uncertainty. "The leader of the vote, by... a margin of twelve, is... Comrade Belozerov?"He couldn't hide the confusion from his face.\n\nNo matter what the reaction was to his plan, Belozerov was one to stick to it. In his view, while radicals on both sides of the spectrum were a threat to democracy, his belief was that the leftist socialists and communists would be much harder to defeat. The only way to break them was to work together with the right. With his negotiations, Belozerov can cause the right to ally with him, thus having enough influence and power in order to take down the left. This would drastically improve democratic poll numbers, and would also secure democracy against the leftist threat. Once the leftist threat was defeated, Komi would be free."
 NIK.34.a:0 "Let's hope it works."

 NIK.35.t:0 "Stalina's Compromise"
 NIK.35.d:0 "After Stalina spoke her closing statement, the clapping of hands - albeit a little forced - echoed in the room. The debate was over, and now was the hour for choosing what exactly must be done to save the democratic party from losing their grip on Komi, before it was too late.\n\n"Comrades, the vote will now begin. Please vote for the candidate you agreed for the most. And not the person you would die for, please."While the last part was whispered to himself, the voting process commenced.\n\n"By a margin of forty, Comrade Stalina's plan will be put into motion."\n\nSvetlana Stalina is a rational woman. While she believes that democracy will always have its hardcore opponents, she also knows that some of those who simply question democracy may be convinced, through certain methods, to reconcile with the democratic party. Stalina's plan involves less harsh anti-radical measures than Kosygin's, and also tries to recapture those who are closer to democracy back. Polarization will be stopped, and the poll numbers will return to normal - maybe even higher - levels. Under her hand, democracy shall reach salvation."
 NIK.35.a:0 "Let's hope it works."

 NIK.36.t:0 "A Message from Zhdanov"
 NIK.36.d:0 "The letter was a simple message. Near the Gribnoy Pereulok, eleven thirty in the evening - sharp. Bring a briefcase. Comrade Zhdanov. Voznesensky scratched his head. Sure, meetings were secret between the two - that much was obvious. His briefcase, however, he would have to find. But that shouldn't take too long...\n\nLights were scarce in these troubled times for Syktyvkar. There were enough aerial problems in the day, after all. The imposing silhouette of the Gribnoy Pereulok shadowed over the dark alley he was assigned to meet him at. Right on cue, a figure shows. Comrade Zhdanov has arrived.\n\nThe conversation was short. "I have for you something that might be of interest to the democratic party. Take these."He shows Voznesensky why he needed the briefcase: papers, and plenty of them. All stamped with the seal of the Communist Party of Komi."
 NIK.36.a:0 "You're welcome... comrade?"

 NIK.37.t:0 "Taking the Internal Files"
 NIK.37.d:0 "Zhdanov glances at Voznesensky as the papers ruffle and shake to the movement of the breeze. The leader of the Republic did not hesitate as he took the files and inspected them. The first document, however, did not promise much. It was essentially a list of names of important, non-rank and file members within the Communist Party, something already known to him. Was this intelligence junk? Other papers were in the pile, of course, but if the first document that was shown to him was obvious information, then hopes were minimal that the rest of them were any better. On the other hand, these files were still important pieces of information, even if copies or already deducted. Surely, keeping backups would be important..."
 NIK.37.a:0 "What could go wrong?"
 NIK.37.b:0 "We've seen this one before..."

 NIK.38.t:0 "The Informational Arsenal"
 NIK.38.d:0 "Walking to his residence, Voznesensky swung his briefcase in his dominant hand. While these files were probably still worthless, it was good to check anyways; they can be used as future reference quite well. As the man went to his home, he stopped at the door and put down the briefcase containing the files. Another stack to put in the archives, he supposed.\n\nLighting the house and, out of paranoia, checking to see if anyone was peering at him, Voznesensky set down the case and opened it. As he saw and, perhaps expected, the first file was something already known: a name list of important figures of the Communist Party of Komi. No specialities. Settling himself in for a long night of bureaucracy, he flipped to the next page - an inventory of armaments in a depot outside of Syktyvkar. Blinking, he almost went to the next page before he stopped himself. He stared at the page - was this a prank? Was this even official? Yet... there was the seal of the Communist Party, and a stamp that marked it as top secret. This information wasn't junk.\n\nIt was a goldmine.\n\nQuickly flipping to the next page, wondering if it was new or old, he saw the title. 'Operatives Monitoring Democratic Activities:' This was certainly new, and was also a small shock. Why would Zhdanov...? No matter! Voznesensky had the tools he needed now to defeat the left: their names and weapons, cataloged and able to be weaponized to the fullest extent. He dialed a number on his telephone and rang - "Grigorenko. Come to my house immediately. I have something that might be of interest to you.""
 NIK.38.a:0 "Perfection!"

 NIK.39.t:0 "Better than the Others"
 NIK.39.d:0 "Voznesensky thought about what Zhdanov was offering him. Sure, they were internal files of the Communist Party of Komi. But Zhdanov was not a man who he completely trusted. And considering that the first file was nothing but already-known junk, he did not have high hopes for the rest of them. Even if they were files that revealed damaging information, what would he be then? Just another plotter in the shadows? Komi has enough of those already. He would become another Gumilyov, or Suslov, and his followers would be known as Voznesenskyites to even his own party. He knew that a couple of old and worthless files was not worth losing party unity for. No matter how he put it, there was no way to justify taking these documents.\n\n"Zhdanov, comrade. I apologize, but there is no point in me taking these documents. They do not help me at all. Thank you for your consideration."He awaited Zhdanov's next words."
 NIK.39.a:0 "Thanks, but no thanks."

 NIK.40.t:0 "Suslov's Secrets"
 NIK.40.d:0 "Voznesensky looked over at the document with a stone-cold expression. Next to him was Petro Grigorenko, his Chief of the General Staff, and Yegor Ligachev, his security minister. All three of them were discussing the documents that had been seen so far, with only two left to go over together. Already, orders had been sent to police around the Republic to prepare for seizure and securing of Communist assets, and appropriate arrests had been carried out in secret. The spoils of these documents had almost been fully reaped, and it seemed that all was almost finished in action.\n\n"Comrades Ligachev, Grigorenko. These two documents and we're finished. Let's see what else is in this pile."The second-to-last document was unearthed from the stack of papers: a long-term operational plan ordered by and carried out by Yuri Andropov, one of Suslov's lieutenants. After a coup of the democratic government, the operation states that the Communist party would expand its territory to other warlord states nearby, eventually taking over much of the old Union."\n\nThe three men glanced at each other before reading the next document: a conversation between Vladimir Semichastny, a key figure on the left, and Suslov. After reading the document, which seemed more like Suslov giving orders to his inferior, the three men discussed it.\n\nFollowing their discussion, they agreed to gather the briefcase and guard it in a secure place, where none could see the machinations inside."
 NIK.40.a:0 "A treasure worth any price."

 NIK.41.t:0 "A Plan Foiled?"
 NIK.41.d:0 "Zhdanov looked over at Voznesensky, retracting his hand and putting the documents away. The two men locked eyes, yet Voznesensky did not see the Zhdanov he usually saw. Avoiding eye contact and looking around, Zhdanov muttered out a few words, perhaps of gratitude, or of regret - but Voznesensky could not tell - and slowly backed away from him. Was Zhdanov planning something, and his plot was now defeated before it even started? Did Zhdanov want to sabotage his party and he stopped it from happening? Could he possibly be even hurt emotionally by the rejection - a close friend betraying him?\n\nAs Zhdanov quietly phased out into the darkness, Voznesensky was left alone with the stars to contemplate."
 NIK.41.a:0 "Perhaps we'll never know."

 NIK.42.t:0 "Zhdanov's Favor"
 NIK.42.d:0 "A little after the clock struck twelve did the call come in. Voznesensky grabbed it with no haste, expecting yet another legislative matter, or perhaps an associate clearing up a request. Repayment was not on his mind, however, when he picked up the phone.\n\n"Comrade Voznesensky, this is Andrei! I hope you have obtained the material and kept it safely."Voznesensky didn't expect the call, but that was fine. A small chat with Zhdanov about the materials, in fact, would be a wise thing to do. "Indeed, I have! Thank you, Comrade Zhdanov. Now, our meeting-"He was interrupted by Zhdanov's next words. "Ah, Nikolai, yes, our meeting. Speaking of that, did you think that I would just give you the documents for free, old friend?" Voznesensky was silent after that, wondering just what he signed up for. "You see, Nikolai, there is a certain organization that has been talking to me. They say that they are being hunted down by your paramilitaries, in fact, and would very much not like to be hunted down by your paramilitaries. Now, Voznesensky, I am aware that you do have the power to fix this, correct? And that I also expect to see it fixed. The All-Komi League of Socialism and Communism would love to know they can sleep safely at night. Thank you, Nikolai."Before Voznesensky had a chance to reply back with any word, Zhdanov hung up. Now it was his turn to fulfill the end of the bargain."
 NIK.42.a:0 "Do we have a choice?"

 NIK.43.t:0 "The Chaos Increases"
 NIK.43.d:0 "The irregular sound of pistol shots and yelling helped set the tone for the meeting. Voznesensky, Malyshev, Grigorenko, and all of their associates were discussing the latest news: an uptick in street violence between left-wing and right-wing paramilitaries. Since more blood had been spilled onto the streets, the democratic party has been conducting meetings between them and their paramilitaries to see what should be done about this situation.\n\n"This is the perfect opportunity!"Grigorenko yelled, slamming his fist on the table in a display of masochism. "These idiots are fulfilling their blood lust against each other, and draining their numbers! If we go out into the streets now, then we should be able to destroy them all!""Why the hell should we risk injuring our fine men if they're injuring each other already?"Voznesensky replied back. "They'll just start using more drastic methods, maybe even killing each other. No need to deploy anything.""You two, as usual, assume that we have to do either everything to stop them, or nothing to stop them. Have you ever considered simply helping move the process along? Escalating the situation? Do certain actions and blame them on the opposing ideology? Strike from the shadows? These are the kind of things we need to do in order to succeed. Think about it."\n\nAs the screaming and the gunshots continued, the meeting wrapped up, a decision finally being reached."
 NIK.43.a:0 "One should not interrupt their enemy in the process of making a mistake."
 NIK.43.b:0 "Send them in, mop them up."
 NIK.43.c:0 "We shall be everywhere and nowhere."

 NIK.44.t:0 "No Need to Panic"
 NIK.44.d:0 "Huddled civilians cried and cowered in the shop. Outside were dead bodies, two associated with the left and five associated with the right. Blood stained the street and sidewalk, glass and weapons lying at the feet of the deceased. A new era of chaos in the streets and towns of Komi rules over the republic now.\n\nVoznesensky smirked at the news of the most recent confrontation, this time resulting in an unusually high amount of deaths. He was right after all - there was no course of action required. Now, they are killing each other directly in the streets, when before they had only injured each other. The process is happening even quicker than he thought. Soon, the problem would be eradicated completely as the paramilitaries wipe each other out. He sat back in his chair, enjoying the supremacy of his decisions. Nothing to worry about from here on out."
 NIK.44.a:0 "The problem solves itself."

 NIK.45.t:0 "The Shifting Tides"
 NIK.45.d:0 "Voznesensky did not see the changing of the situation at first. It was a slow process, a slogging ordeal for both combatants that left some dead and many more injured on both sides alike. But now, reports have come in from the democratic paramilitaries and the citizens of Komi. More and more, the injured and killed come from the right-wing paramilitaries - they appear more scared as they go to fight, less of Gumilyov's men show up to confront the leftist forces, and Gumilyov himself has been rumored to be in a state of disarray following a decisive defeat in Vilegodsk in which his forces have been completely driven out of the city.\n\nWhile fights are still ongoing in Syktyvkar, and the left-wing paramilitaries still suffer many casualties, it is now clear that the balance is tilting towards Suslov and his armies in the streets, which may prove to be a challenge in the future. But for now, Voznesensky pays it no mind. The right will come back from this minor setback, surely."
 NIK.45.a:0 "Concerning..."

 NIK.46.t:0 "Red Stars on the Poll Booths"
 NIK.46.d:0 "He was blindsided by the news. He couldn't believe any of it. How were they able to do that? How...\n\nThe leftist radicals have declared victory in the streets. Following a particularly gruesome battle near the legislative building in Syktyvkar between Suslov's elite paramilitary unit and cobbled together volunteers of Gumilyov's forces, in which the winner was obvious, the rightist paramilitaries have showed up less and less. Gumilyov, for now, has been defeated in the paramilitary struggle, and although his forces fight on, none are sure he may ever be able to regain the strength he once had again.\n\nVoznesensky, upon hearing this, was about to burst into one of his characteristic tyrades when another piece of news hit: voters were now being intimidated by these paramilitaries. Electoral districts have shifted control from more democratic-leaning to fully leftist-leaning, and some communists have even had the audacity to graffiti red stars onto the polling booths, letting all who vote know who is nearby. Shifting, wanting to speak, wanting to explode onto the news bringer violently, he found that he couldn't. Wearily sighing, he simply waved the courier out of his room."
 NIK.46.a:0 "How could it have gotten so far?"

 NIK.47.t:0 "Embracing the Moderates"
 NIK.47.d:0 "The poll numbers are up, for once."Yet another meeting, yet another piece of news. At least this piece of news was pleasant. Voznesensky blinked and asked him to explain how this could happen when the radicals were about to stage their 'fair' election victory.\n\n"According to... well, a survey, yes, I know it's a survey, but just stick with me. According to that survey, many of them are people who are newly supportive of democracy. It seems after the violence was started by the radicals of both the left and the right, the moderates of both wings became terrified that they would be targeted both by the enemy and within their own ideology. Thus, they now flee to us for their safety and protection."\n\nVoznesensky was at least glad that he might have a chance of surviving these next elections. Speaking some token words of approval he couldn't bother to remember, the meeting carried on."
 NIK.47.a:0 "Something good comes out of this."

 NIK.48.t:0 "The Shifting Tides"
 NIK.48.d:0 "The changing of the balance was something unnoticed at first. Yet, as time continued on, something seemed more apparent. Rumors were that Suslov had been showing up less and less to his meetings. The battles have gotten bloodier, the left-wing in particular becoming more desperate in their fighting methods. Apparently, the left-wing paramilitaries are being beaten back on the streets, with some fighting apparently even happening in fully communist-controlled areas.\n\nVoznesensky fidgeted at the news. While he knew that fighting would still go on for a long while, as the left is very equipped and powerful, it did not ease him to know that the right wing, with Gumilyov at the helm, is growing ever-more powerful in the outside world, away from the chambers of power. However, Voznesensky had faith in the left-wing paramilitaries. Surely, they will beat Gumilyov back, and kill each other. Surely."
 NIK.48.a:0 "Concerning..."

 NIK.49.t:0 "Springtime for Gumilyov?"
 NIK.49.d:0 "Voznesensky could not believe what he heard. How was this possible? How did they do it? How...\n\nIn the streets of Syktyvkar and the small towns of the republic, the rightist paramilitaries are supreme. After an intense and hard-fought battle between Suslov's reservists and Gumilyov's elite, SS-modelled bodyguards, of which the winner was clear, the leftist paramilitaries have retreated from the streets, only showing up to protect certain key electoral districts and influential leftist figures. Although Suslov fights on, and with still much power to eventually wreak havoc on the right, Gumilyov has gained the advantage in the battle of Komi.\n\nVoznesensky began to cuss out the poor courier when he realized something. If Gumilyov has already taken control of several communist districts, that means he is very much able to intimidate voters in those districts, as well as democratic districts. In a 'fair' vote, Voznesensky would be defeated. Cursing out the carrier as much as he could, he knew that the end could be near for him."
 NIK.49.a:0 "How could it have gotten so far?"

 NIK.50.t:0 "Peace through Superior Firepower"
 NIK.50.d:0 "Grigorenko grinned as he saw the beautiful T-34. An old relic of the wars of Russia, yet still an effective killing machine, the commander was proud to say that this tank was now part of his paramilitary - and would drive the radicals out.\n\nWhen Voznesensky approved, reluctantly, Grigorenko's suggestion for equipping and sending out his paramilitaries to fight, he immediately went to work on preparing his forces for the battles ahead. New drills with new rifles. New tanks to crush the Suslovites and the Gumilyovites with. New powers to destroy the enemies of democracy.\n\nAs the orders were given to begin engaging fascist and communist paramilitaries, Grigorenko personally led his forces to the streets of Syktyvkar, ready to fight. Ready to win."
 NIK.50.a:0 "Do us proud."

 NIK.51.t:0 "A Cordial Request"
 NIK.51.d:0 "Voznesensky's work was interrupted when one of his secretaries entered his office. The stocky man nodded toward his boss and wordlessly made his way to the desk. "From Zhdanov "was his underling's only comment. Voznesensky did not bother to look up from the memo as the secretary closed the door behind him.\n\nZhdanov's message was polite. The cordial word to the president of the Republic succinctly made a case for the end of targeted paramilitary campaigns against the communists. For reasons of military security as well as to prevent radical elements from destabilizing the left. It would not do, after all, for communist citizens in Komi to see the government turn its back on them. Nor would it do any good to have brave communist soldier gunned down by the government.\n\nVoznesensky's eyes were still on the memo when his underling brought his afternoon tea. Deep in reflection, the politician thanked his secretary, but did not lift his eyes off the message."
 NIK.51.a:0 "Why would we?"
 NIK.51.b:0 "Let's try it, at least."
 
 NIK.52.t:0 "A Propaganda Surge!"
 NIK.52.d:0 "A leaflet among many, distributed it in mass the last few weeks. "Where were you citizens, when the bourgeois government made open its ties to fascists and reactionaries?"\n\nThe leaflet fluttered down the street. The wind's whimsy brought it under a new propaganda poster. A brutish soldier stood poised to stab worker militiamen from behind. From the soldier's shadow, a twin hydra of fascism and conservatism. "The so called democrats have always been threats to the worker's revolution. End the massacre of brave communist patriots! "\n\nAfter admiring his printers' handywork, Zhdanov rolled up the window of his car and asked his chauffeur to drive on. Better stay off the streets in these troubled times."
 NIK.52.a:0 "Damnation!"
 
 NIK.53.t:0 "Suspicions within the Party"
 NIK.53.d:0 "The population did not know why the violent campaign against the communists had started. Neither did they know why it had ended suddenly.\n\nReports coming in from the democratic party made it clear that the general population's confusion was replaced in the government by dismay. Internal memos trying to assess where the order had come from. Centrist Apparatchik apparently clued in rapidly that the order had come from the top, and a few ill advised conversation over drinks had been dutifully recorded by Suslov's men. Suspicions that Voznesensky had capitulated to the left were corroborated with a few bribes given to key military men of the regime. Making sure of loyalty in tough times? Many governmental paramilitaries would have been incensed to see their prize taken away.\n\nSuslov read the final report before neatly adding it to the pile. The socialist leader was intrigued by the whirlwind of violence and capitulation. He pondered if Zhdanov had made himself useful for once, and stopped the violence against the left. Only time would tell."
 NIK.53.a:0 "Another trap!"
 
 NIK.54.t:0 "Silver Bullet Holes"
 NIK.54.d:0 "A fresh crop of political violence was harvested today in Komi as the headquarters of several radical paramilitaries of all political affiliations began burning down today. The string of fires broke out in a rapid succession, overwhelming Komi's fire department. The buildings had not yet stopped smouldering before manifestations broke out against the arsonists. The protests turned ugly when the crowd could not determined who had really been behind it. In between helping with the fires and quelling riots, quite a few law enforcement officials lost their lives to the chaos. Their funerals will run concurrently with those of a range of paramilitary leaders and soldiers, lost to the blaze and smoke. Ordinary citizens of Syktyvkar have not been spared, for fire and hatred both spread easily in such a large city."
 NIK.54.a:0 "The only upside..."
 
 NIK.55.t:0 "The Smoke and Mirrors"
 NIK.55.d:0 "Pyotr Grigorenko is a man with a plan. In his city, thugs and drifters with no clear ambition join paramilitaries and look for the fight of their life. Why not provide it to them?\n\nIt would, of course, not do for an officer of the democratic government to be seen running around with paramilitary types. This is why Grigorenko does not advertise much his status as head of one of the biggest militias that backs the government. But his slow acquisition of soldiers of fortune and desperados has not been for nothing. Now the time comes to let some steam off Komi's fragile military apparatus.\n\nGrigorenko's men have begun a mass campaign of violence against the far left and far right. Much creative efforts have gone into his little project. Fascist leaders are found killed in the communist's favorite fashion. A stolen truck of the far right is filled with explosives and parked close to a communist meeting. Through all this, governmental soldiers associated with the extremes are found mysteriously dead. As the city descends into chaos, the extremists are likely to assume the useless centrist government is unable to protect them. Why not take action into their own hands, after all? From this initial wave of false flag attack, the good officer hopes to see the radicals throw one another in a mass grave of their own making. After all, it would not be proper for the government to be involved in such untidy violence."
 NIK.55.a:0 "Could it even work?"
 
 NIK.56.t:0 "A Bloodless Victory"
 NIK.56.d:0 "The inferno of political street fighting in Komi has begun to peter out. The far right and far left have run out of angry men with weapons. Dead, wounded or in despair about the loss of so many comrades to violence, members of various paramilitaries have begun pushing on their bosses for a temporary ceasefire. The thug's urge to turn swords into plowshare is probably helped by the complete stalemate. There appears to be no clear winner between the far right and far left, for all radical paramilitaries have been bloodied in the conflict. Temporary gains have inevitably turned into disastrous losses as the cycle of revenge went on. Militia men that had one day been struggling to carry their loot had been found dead in alleyways the next day.\n\nOne side, however, has made it through unsscathed. The government's men, both in the army and off it, have been strangely uninvolved in the conflagration. As a result, few men of the centre have seen their military careers cut violently short. Where once it seemed inevitable to see extremists overwhelm the government, now the centrists hold a fair share of the balance of power."
 NIK.56.a:0 "A surprise, but a welcome one."
 
 NIK.57.t:0 "Silent Contemplation"
 NIK.57.d:0 "Stalina's office was tucked away in a distant corner of the building. This suited her, for few party members or employee ever wandered into her room by mistake. All the better to lose herself in thinking.\n\nLike her boss Voznesensky she liked to keep a clean office. In Komi, a small bubble of relative stability had been established from the Russian Anarchy. Her office's peace and quiet was to the rest of the governmental building a microcosm of what Komi should be to the rest of Russia. Could be.\n\nThe light flickered. The woman looked briefly to her small collection of candles. They were useful to keep around; a full day's worth of electricity was a rare treat in modern Russia.\n\nHer office was peaceful and orderly. The militias and paramilitaries made Komi a right mess. But how to get rid of them? Their leader kept the men on a short leash, lean and angry and looking for a scrap. It would probably not be too difficult to push the men over the edge and into open conflict. The small fries were never told why exactly they fought the men they fought; only when to strike. In this situation, perhaps a set of false flag attack might cause the rank and file to pressure their leaders for vengeance and retribution? Keeping angry, violent men on such a short leash was a double edged sword. The promise of violence led to expectations of violence.\n\nIn the shadows of Komi lurked radicals, idiots willing to invite the violence of the Russian Anarchy to Komi. The guardians of orders would need to invite violence in kind. No mercy for the enemies of stability."
 NIK.57.a:0 "Useful, someday."
 
 NIK.58.t:0 "Svetlana's Theories"
 NIK.58.d:0 "Voznesensky often wandered the halls of his party's edifice to stretch his legs. Every now and then, the president of the republic saw his steps bring him to the door of one particular staircase. That way lay the path to Stalina's office. A strange location for the rising star of Komi's democratic politics. But the young woman had politely refused to move to a better office. Perhaps she treasured her peace and quiet ?\n\nQuiet, Voznesensky had accepted he would have very little off when he became head of the young republic. Peace, on the other hand, he desperately craved. Each day brought in new problems. Schemes, intrigues, plots, manipulations. It drained him to keep track of the cards in play, and of the players holding them. This was in addition of his role as head of state. Keeping the economy chugging along, managing foreign policy, sifting through reports on the closest Russian warlords. He had very little time to make his own moves. Neither did Kosygin. Busy with keeping the nation afloat, the democrats could do little against the extremist's schemes.\n\nVoznesensky found his hand on the door's handle. A flight of stairs. A corridor. A knock on the young woman's door. Another request. Another confident smile and nod.\n\nSvetlana Stalina's had arrived in Komi with nothing. She had fallen in love at first sight with her new home. The young woman loved Komi's stability, its order, its promise of progress. The radicals she hated with a passion. In them she saw echoes of the failed Soviet Union, of the evil fascist power that had plunged Russia in anarchy. She had joined the democrats in their efforts, and her intelligence, charisma and work ethics had charmed many. Others feared her and her own brand of radicalism. No amount of bloodshed would be too great for Komi. To party members tired of political violence she proposed a wave of terror to end all terrors.\n\nVoznesensky remained at the top of the stairs. He knew not if he wanted to go down."
 NIK.58.a:0 "We need her more than ever."
 NIK.58.b:0 "We can't afford to need her this much."
 
 NIK.59.t:0 "A Victory for Publicity"
 NIK.59.d:0 "Voznesensky shrugged off his fatigue. Stalina had been nothing but loyal, trustworthy asset, he though as he went down the stairs. To the spin doctors of the far right and far left, the democrats had struggled to find answer. Now Stalina led the charge at the head of a new generation of democratic politicians. Men and women unable to accept the death of a free and stable Komi without fighting.\n\nHer radicalism and influence were of course points of contention. But as long as they were well monitored, Voznesensky had in the young woman in indispensable ace in the hole. His support for her would of course need to be well calibrated, to avoid upsetting Stalina's detractor within the centrist coalition. But every decision in Komi required careful calibration anyway.\n\nA knock on his underling's door. "Yes, you can enter."The president did so. "Ahh, Nikolai. I wanted to discuss with you."The older politician smiled. "Fancy dinner? We can catch up over some food.""Only if you pay, Comrade President.""

 NIK.60.d:0 "The president continued his walk. Useful as she may be, the rising star of the party still had to be reined in. Schemes and plots that went outside the knowledge of the party higher ups was an especially big no-no. Voznesensky was quite certain that his underling's plan was targeted at the extremists, fair and square. But no one knew how far she would go. And Voznesensky had not stayed in the business for so long without learning never to give out blank cheques.\n\nLater, over dinner he wrote out a few memos. The party whip in particular he needed to meet. Stalina would receive an official warning. Heaven knew that it might not be enough to stop her. But it might at least serve as a cold shower on her ambition by signalling to her that the party was watching."

As the violence has spread to several sectors held by the far right, areas of the city held by the far left have seen unusual activity. Many communist militias have moved into the open, aggressively pursuing protection money from new businesses. In effect, the left wing has expanded the size of its operations in formerly neutral or right wing sectors. Several political manifestations supporting the far left have applied increased pressure on the government, profiting from its inability to respond.\n\nSomewhere in the great game of Komi intrigue, Suslov must be smiling contentedly. A great deal of his activities are now going unchallenged, as his opponents are busy with one another."

 NIK.62.t:0 "A Reconstruction Government?"
 NIK.62.d:0 "Secret meetings are part and parcel of political life in Komi. Yet it takes a special set of circumstances for the absolute highest level of security to be deployed. Deep in the chamber of the coalition's headquarters, with only a handpicked few bodyguards as witnesses, the leaders of the three democratic parties as well as Vice-President Rodionov have agreed to a meeting with the democratic coalition's rising star.\n\nIt did not take long for the cat to come out of the bag. Svetlana Stalina directly brought up the subject; Komi's republic is in a bad shape. With extremist faction sharpening their knives, not long remains before the political system is judged obsolete and powerful forces try to unseat it. The best and only option is thus to strike first. By suspending democracy and marshaling all of the state's power, the center can hold off extremism and maintain a reconstruction government until the coast is clear. From this initial statement, the meeting went on..."

 NIK.62.b:0 "This is too far."
 
 NIK.63.t:0 "Considerations"
 NIK.63.d:0 "The three heads of Komi's moderate political parties have had plenty of experience with keeping a good poker face. Even so, Stalina's daring proposal has set in motion many sets of gears inside the four men's head. Outwardly, however, the conversation has seen little more than questions about the details of Stalina's plan. A few token objections have been raised, to test the young woman's ideas. In the end, of a common accord the three party leaders agreed that the proposal had merit, and requested more time to consider the issue. Vice president Rodionov silently approved Voznesensky's proposal. Stalina agreed, satisfied with her progress. The daring proposal might have impressed some of the three men about her growing confidence. Perhaps a reshuffling of the political landscape might be on her horizon?"
 NIK.63.a:0 "Placated, for now."
 
 NIK.64.t:0 "A Meeting on the Side"
 NIK.64.d:0 "Some time after the meeting, the replies started to trickle into Stalina's mailbox. First came the social democrats; Voznesensky and Rodionov seemed the least enthused about the Reconstruction Government of the four. Then came the conservative leader's answer. After many circular reasonings, the man did not reveal much of his thoughts, and thus his opinion remained to be determined. Kosygin's reply was very different. He communicated through intermediaries a request to Stalina for a private meeting.\n\nKeeping a secret from one's own political allies can be as difficult as hiding it from enemies. Yet in a remote spot of the republic, the two politicians managed to meet. The leader of the liberals confided to Stalina his concern about the security situation. If the time came for such a drastic measure, Kosygin would support the young politician's proposal."

 NIK.65.d:0 "Kosygin often found his cabinet had devolved back into a mess of shuffled papers and documents. He was not fond of letting his secretaries clean it, and so once a week he began the task of reordering everything.\n\nIn between a report on the agricultural sector's output in the last few years and a memoranda about the state of highway funding was a strange unmarked letter. The leader of the liberals absentmindedly opened it. His heart skipped a beat; addressed to him by name, the letter described itself as "coming from a friend". Its content preposterously claimed to prove that President Voznesensky was a paid plant for Zhdanov.\n\nKosygin folded the letter back and slid it inside his breast pocket. His secretaries were used to see their boss tear off on some errand without informing them. The politician walked through the building, eventually reaching the quiet section where Stalina's office was.\n\nThe young politician was shocked to see Kosygin break his own rules about meeting one another in public. Her surprise only grew when he passed to her wordlessly an envelope."
 NIK.65.a:0 "A traitor at the very top...?"
 
 NIK.66.t:0 "Beginning the Investigation"
 NIK.66.d:0 "The origin of the tip off remained a secret. Verifying the proof's truth was thus a difficult proposal. But the seeds of doubt remained in Stalina and Kosygin's mind. Rumors of an improper friendship between Zhdanov and President Voznesensky cropped every now and then in Komi's wild world of political speculations. A few remembered how both men had been associates in the murky past of the WRRF days, despite their later falling out over political differences. The allegation of modern financial and political links was a very serious one that needed proper investigation.\n\nThe investigation would need to be secret, of course. How else would the ties between a communist leader of the opposition and the president of the Republic be ascertained? Both men were too used to Komi's political scene to be sloppy about any relationship. If news came out of this secret investigation, the president would deny everything. Stalina and Kosygin's career would likely never recover. Prudence was the order of the day."
 NIK.66.a:0 "Ask him for answers. Now."
 NIK.66.b:0 "There's no need for confrontation."
 
 NIK.67.t:0 "The Confrontation"
 NIK.67.d:0 "Another meeting in the depth of the ruling coalition's headquarters. Stalina, Rodionov, and Kosygin sat across President Voznesensky's seat. The social democrat politician chuckled something about not expecting to be thrown in front of the inquisition. Silently, Stalina pushed a manilla folder across the table. The President's attempt at levity having failed, he accepted without comment the set of papers and began leafing through them.\n\nA slight frown creased his traits. Worry? Confusion? None of the assembled democratic politicians could decide. All awaited for Voznesensky's response."
 NIK.67.a:0 "Oh?"
 
 NIK.68.t:0 "A Stable Partnership"
 NIK.68.d:0 "The President began by thanking the assembled democrats for trusting him with this delicate matter. The consequences to the coalition's trust might have been incalculable if doubt had been allowed to fester. The horror of seeing trusted colleagues scheming behind his back in a protracted witch hunt could have spelled the end of the President's work in the coalition.\n\nThe proof in question, he went on to explain, was clever for it used confusing places in his finances and assets to create the illusion of an unexplained amount of missing money where corruption could have been present. If the assembled men and women could give him a few hours, all would be explained.\n\nA break was indeed called, and food brought down. Stalina exchanged a glance with Kosygin. The older man did not seem to know where all this was going either.\n\nIn the afternoon, a swathe of financial papers was presented. Kosygin slowly ascertained their accuracy. As it turned, the numbers really meshed. Stalina was the first to get up from her seat and reach over to the president to shake his hand. "Someone has tried to mislead us, and for that I apologize.". The president shook her hand."
 NIK.68.a:0 "Unsafe, certainly. Necessary, possibly."
 
 NIK.69.t:0 "The Conspiracy"
 NIK.69.d:0 "No hunter would just stroll into the open and announce to its prey that the hunt is on. The secret investigation that began as a project by Kosygin and Stalina has been carefully expanded to a trusted few liberal higher-ups. Sub-ministers within Stalina's growing, and accountants helping Kosygin on economic matters, as well as a few intelligence men with ties to both politicians. The goal is to expand the nets of a conspiracy to figure out if Voznesensky has been compromised. By comparing classified information available to a range of different governmental role with whatever intelligence can be found on the communist factions' inner workings. Hopefully a slip up can be used to crack open the case."
 NIK.69.a:0 "You made us do this, Nikolai."
 
 NIK.70.t:0 "Approaching the Left"
 NIK.70.d:0 "Stalina's affinity with the social demoratic party had seen her grow ever closer to many of its main players. Yet bringing up the accusation of improper final transactions by the party's leader and President of the Republic took a certain amount of prudence. The young politician requested a private meeting with Vice President Rodionov and a few trustworthy men of the Social Democrat party to share her information.\n\nThe meeting's atmosphere was electric. The men suspected a rare event for Stalina to summon such an illustrious group. The absence of the president spoke volume about the gravity of the situation.\n\nWith everyone gathered, Stalina arranged her papers and began the meeting."
 NIK.70.a:0 "Let's hope they're not compromised."
 
 NIK.71.t:0 "Our Cover Blown!"
 NIK.71.d:0 "Voznesensky knows!\n\nThe president casually brought up rumors of an internal party crisis to Kosygin. Voznesensky expressed dismay at the rumor, and said he had informed Kosygin first to make sure this mystery cabal would not train its attention on the Liberal Party's leader. Kosygin was shaken by the implied threat; it was he could to thank the president and vow assistance in ending this shadowy cabal.\n\nWho could have betrayed them? Suspicion fell on Vice President Rodionov, but Stalina pointed out how the logistics of it didn't make sense.\n\nThe president didn't know the full extent of things, but he certainly knew that eyes were trained on him. The secret investigation was perhaps running out of time."
 NIK.71.a:0 "Is nobody loyal? Bury this!"
 NIK.71.b:0 "Give it one last try. Come clean."
 
 NIK.72.t:0 "Burying the Dirt"
 NIK.72.d:0 "The best way forward was to kill the investigation and bury everything. Members of the investigation were cut out of the secret conspiracy one by one, with a combination of threats and promises ensuring they would keep the secret. A few expendable informants were moved out of the city for the time being. Financial information that had served as Kosygin's bedtime reading disappeared up the chimney.\n\n\n\nIt was all they could do. . . But as it turned out, it wasn't enough. The President diligently appraised his ally Kosygin of every bit of progress hunting down the secret conspiracy. The walls were closing in on Kosygin and Stalina."
 NIK.72.a:0 "May it never again arise."
 
 NIK.73.t:0 "Traitors to Democracy?"
 NIK.73.d:0 "Both partners in crimes stood in front of the higher ups of the democratic Coalition. Voznesensky spoke most often. He communicated his anger and dismay that the economist and the young politician had gone behind his back and instigated a witch hunt within the party. Had it spread, the damage to party unity might have been incalculable.\n\nBoth would be censured for their activity. As their intention had been to defend the coalition from possible infiltration, both culprits would be allowed to continue their political work. But from now on their work would be heavily monitored by members of the coalition.\n\nIn the panel of party activists censoring them, many former members of the conspiracy. What could they do? Stalina and Kosygin had cut them off to limit the damage. Anyone advocating mercy risked incurring Voznesensky's ire on their head. The two culprits would have to suffer in isolation."
 NIK.73.a:0 "Can Komi be saved?"
 
 NIK.74.t:0 "A Successful Ploy"
 NIK.74.d:0 "'And so, the contradictions of capitalism shall lead to a World War, bringing in the new phase of world socialism.'\n\nSuslov's theory has proven itself accurate. With his plot to tear the liberals apart by stoking paranoia through his agents, the center was already splitting into irrelevant chunks. With every trial and accusation coming out of the formerly ironclad "coalition for democracy", he had another reason to celebrate.\n\nYes, Gumilyov, the esotericist madman, was still credible opposition, no matter how much he hated to say it. But Zhdanov had done his job well, and his attempt to seize power for himself by collaborating with the Voznesentsi had easily been twisted for the more... pure aims of the Revolution.\n\nOf course, he didn't know that Suslov was onto him. He wouldn't be punished... but perhaps a reminder was in order.\n\nYes, in the microcosm of the outside world that was Komi, the seeds of the Revolution had just been planted. All that remained to be done was finally break the opposition, and the red flag would fly once more."
 NIK.74.a:0 "Make it so."
 
 NIK.75.t:0 "The Confession"
 NIK.75.d:0 "Voznesensky and the party's whips were breathing down their necks. Time was running out. And so Kosygin decided to play the last good card he held in his rapidly shrinking deck.\n\nVoznesensky did not make a good show of looking surprised at Kosygin's request for a private meeting. When meeting the leader of the Liberals, the President of the Republic simply said "Well?"once both were alone. Kosygin sighed. The explanation would be painful. But living through the humiliation was perhaps their only way out. And so, Kosygin began to detail what he and Stalina had been up to."
 NIK.75.a:0 "Is it enough?"
 
 NIK.76.t:0 "The Leak Revealed"
 NIK.76.d:0 "The thought could initially be put aside by Kosygin. In the panic to save himself and Stalina from Voznesensky, the leader of the liberals did not have much interest in figuring out how exactly Stalina and him had seen their scheme revealed. After pulling aside the president and coming clean with his secret investigation, the leader of the liberals found himself with a lot of spare time as he waited to hear about his fate.\n\nIn this new abundance of free time, Kosygin's mind raced back to the cause of his trouble. How exactly had the president figured out the investigation team's activities, again? Voznesensky had made an offhand comment about one of his men's finding.\n\nSomething didn't add up, however. There was no way this particular informant could have known the details of the investigation that ended up in Voznesensky's hands. Perhaps then someone had forwarded the information to this man? Certainly not Zhdanov, for leaking his alliance with the President to the democratic coalition would lose him a great trump card. The far right might have known, but Kosygin didn't feel they were behind this. No, this particular man of Voznesensky's inner circle might in fact be a Suslov acquaintance. The other master of the far left would certainly be in a position to weaken his rival and the government all at once.\n\nKosygin called to his secretary. The others in the democratic coalition needed to hear of this theory, no matter what."
 NIK.76.a:0 "How is this possible?"
 
 NIK.77.t:0 "The Eye of the Enemy"
 NIK.77.d:0 "Voznesensky was understandably a little bit grouchy at being dragged out to a new meeting by an avowed traitor. Still, his political instincts, his friendship with Kosygin or something else convinced him to make the trip. Stalina was equally present, sitting by Kosygin's side, gazing sternly ahead.\n\nVoznesensky sat in silence as he listened to Kosygin's explanation. It did not take an expert on body language to see how troubled the President was by Kosygin's theory.\n\nKosygin was the first to break the silence. "So, a mysterious information drop reached you and Stalina, accusing the president of being a Zhanovite plant. And then, a new source of information alerted the president that his own party was rebellious." He nodded gravely. "If Suslov was behind the leak to the president, perhaps he was also behind the first leak to you and Stalina. If so, his infiltration of the party would need to be quite complete. Had I or president Voznesensky heard about information falling into your hands, the whole scheme would have broken down."\n\nTo these words, the three men and women fell silent. The implications were too catastrophic to discuss out loud."
 NIK.77.a:0 "Plots and maleficence, everywhere!"
 
 NIK.78.t:0 "Reigning in the Party"
 NIK.78.d:0 "Suslov walked a little easier these days. Even with his legion of spies in the government, it was never simple to determine why exactly the democratic parties did anything they did. Their leaders, although allies and mostly friendly to one another, jealousy hoarded their considerable personal influence. As a result it was a rare event for anyone to claim ownership of an unpopular policy such as ending the pressure on the far left.\n\nNo matter the cause, the end of the war on the far left let Suslov move more easily. Aggressive and ambitious underlings had pressured their boss to move violently against the government and far-right. Now that the bloodshed and propaganda war was over, a lot of Suslov's loyalists were free to crack some skulls and twist some arms to re-establish order. The fact he had calmly weathered the storm gave Suslov a lot of credibility, for now the left stood strong and the government appeared weak."
 NIK.78.a:0 "They will not fall to revisionism."
 
 NIK.79.t:0 "A Request for a Ceasefire"
 NIK.79.d:0 "The violent struggle between the government and the far left had left an opening for Gumilyov's scheme. Now the spectre of a far right take-over haunted Komi's young republic. Far-right paramilitaries had begun crawling out of their districts, moving into democratic and communist territories alike as the depleted manpower of both faction left them unable to oppose this take-over.\n\nIt was a risk for a face-to-face meeting to occur between Zhdanov and the president. But desperate hours called for desperate measures. Once both had reached the secluded meeting spot in the woods outside of Syktyvkar, Zhdanov requested his old friend an end to active hostilities between the government and the communists. Such a ceasefire would let both sides turn their attention to Gumilyov's imminent takeover attempt.\n\nThe president listened to Zhdanov's case without comment. Any question he asked might reveal information about the government's position. When the Communist leader finally fell silent, Voznesensky announced his intentions..."
 NIK.79.a:0 "He's gone too far."
 NIK.79.b:0 "Let's keep this between us..."
 
 NIK.80.t:0 "Refusing the Ceasefire"
 NIK.80.d:0 "The response was short, and polite. Voznesensky explained to Zhdanov that the government had no intention of ending the pressure on the communists.\n\nZhdanov excused himself and walked back to his bodyguards. The president watched his old friend being driven away, his expression indecipherable. Soon, he too had gone back to his bodyguards. His car soon drove off in the night."
 NIK.80.a:0 "There will be blood."
 
 NIK.81.t:0 "The Split Front"
 NIK.81.d:0 "Had there ever been a lull in the fighting? For the briefest of moments, the governmental and communist militias had stopped their clashes. Had it been fear at the rise of the far right militias? Or perhaps some inscrutable order from on top.\n\nThe lull, if it had ever existed, was shattered by a renewal of the violence. Both sides fought savagely. After all, only the extermination of the other would allow the victor to turn around to face the far right.\n\nSomewhere in Syktyvkar, Gumilyov smiled over a map of the city. Things were progressing smoothly."
 NIK.81.a:0 "We must only hope it was the right choice."
 
 NIK.82.t:0 "Zhdanov's Ceasefire"
 NIK.82.d:0 "One day the government's troops were attacking communist districts. The next, the democratic coalition's men were redeploying across the city. New positions were drafted to stop the progression of the far right's men.\n\nNo official announcement was made on the topic. It was left to the public to deduce the loose alliance that now united the communist and democrats. After all, the new combat lines of the reds and democrats would have made no sense otherwise. Vast sections of the democratic and communist districts were left lightly guarded by their owners if their frontiers happened to touch the other side's areas. This level of cooperation, as well as the heightened level of militarization of the front line with the far right demonstrated that at least some coordination had been agreed upon.\n\nGreatest loser in all this were the far right paramilitaries, suddenly pushed back from their over-extended positions. The government's temporary united front with the communist appeared to be working as intended."
 NIK.82.a:0 "Allies across the lines."
 
 NIK.83.t:0 "A Traitor?"
 NIK.83.d:0 "The two politicians were united by their distrust of the ceasefire with the reds. Stalina loathed the extremist factions for endangering Komi, while the more moderate Kosygin was worried less by the ceasefire than its implication. How the hell had the president managed to reach a deal with the reds? To the liberal leader's eyes, this secret deal meant the president must have held secret ties to the far left.\n\nThe 'rightist' members of the democratic coalition began planning a joint action against Voznesensky. The president was proving himself to be a liability to the democratic cause, and some sense needed to be talked into him... Or imposed at gunpoint, if necessary."
 NIK.83.a:0 "Peace must come first."
 NIK.83.b:0 "We are done with talk."
 
 NIK.84.t:0 "The Militarists' Confrontation"
 NIK.84.d:0 "Voznesensky looked at them benevolently, his eyes rising above a pile of paperwork. "I was told Rodionov would be present, yes?"\n\nKosygin shrugged. "He has a cold today. Voznesensky, we came here today about the ceasefire with the left. This shit can't go on. "The president cocked an eyebrow. "The left is rising in power every day. I can't take an evening walk without bumping into Suslov informants. We've had their paramilitary on the ropes with the campaign against them, and now you let them escape? If we don't destroy them now they'll relieve us of our jobs."\n\nThe president closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, his reply was confident..."
 NIK.84.a:0 "There will be no compromise!"
 NIK.84.b:0 "You see, this was the plan all along..."
 
 NIK.85.t:0 "No Compromise!"
 NIK.85.d:0 "I understand your concerns. But I'm not budging on this. During our campaign on the communist we began hemorrhaging territory to the far right. We need to crush the fascists if this republic is to last the year. If you have other concerns, feel free to bring them up to me now. Otherwise, this lovely pile of paper requires presidential signatures. "\n\nKosygin and Stalina were taken aback. Voznesensky waited expectantly for another round of argument. However, his colleagues stiffly offered him goodbye and left. The president sighed and returned to the task at hand."
 NIK.85.a:0 "What is he hiding?"
 
 NIK.86.t:0 "Voznesensky Folds"
 NIK.86.d:0 "I understand your concerns. But this has just been a temporary plan. Our men are waiting for the communist to surge out against the fascist before we turn on them. From the start I didn't trust the communist to uphold any bargain made. Thus, this method of finishing them off while also repulsing the far right's attack. "\n\n"I see."Kosygin said. Stalina's expression remained difficult to interpret. Was she buying his excuses? "We'll let you to it, Voznesensky. Sorry for bothering you. I might drop by later when the time comes to send the orders to turn on the reds, yes?"\n\n"It would be my pleasure. We'll send the encrypted orders over the radio to our commanders."Said the president, his eyes already back to his tax forms. Kosygin and Stalina left without any further word."
 NIK.86.a:0 "We can all get along, no?"
 
 NIK.87.t:0 "The Leak"
 NIK.87.d:0 "Commander names, streets, positions, hours. The radio broadcast over public frequencies didn't arouse much more than curiosity from the average civilian. But to anyone invested in Komi's great game, the communication was crystal clear. The message was a set of deployment order to governmental militias, arraying them to the rear of almost every communist militia. The only reason for such a deployment was not hard to divine.\n\nThe message was confirmed to be the real deal when policemen aligned with the democratic coalition jammed every radio frequency they could find. The government's panic demonstrated their guilt. The plan had been the annihilation of every communist brigade that could be trapped on the front line against the far right. Now everybody knew of the democrats' duplicity."
 NIK.87.a:0 "How could this be?!"
 
 NIK.88.t:0 "The Infiltrators"
 NIK.88.d:0 "The scale of the leak was titanic. To betray the deployment order of every democratic paramilitary, one would need men inside every brigade. This was the only way to break every secret cipher in a single twenty-four hour period.\n\nNot only had Suslov infiltrated the highest level of the democratic parties, the democratic paramilitaries were deeply compromised as well. The government had no secret left to fight back against the far left's puppet master."
 NIK.88.a:0 "A nest of traitors and spies!"
 
 NIK.89.t:0 "All Quiet from Zhdanov"
 NIK.89.d:0 "Voznesensky removed the brick from the wall and rummaged inside the hole. Nothing but his original message attempt.\n\nSince the disastrous radio leak, it had been impossible to reach Zhdanov. None of the usual dead drop locations had seen any activity. Voznesensky was tempted to use the emergency channel they had reserved for immediate communication. But Zhdanov's continued silence communicated a message in itself. The president burning his last contact method to hear his old friend's silent fury would not be productive.\n\nVoznesensky picked up the brick. Instead of closing up the dead drop, the politician threw the brick as far as he could. The projectile hit a distant lamppost with a loud "thunk". "When has everything gone so goddamn wrong?"Voznesensky thought bitterly."
 NIK.89.a:0 "The final betrayal."
 
 NIK.90.t:0 "Rumors of a Rising Star"
 NIK.90.d:0 "Komi's great game of politics has always ran on a steady diet of rumors. Knowing what one's opponents are doing is crucial if one desires to remain in the game. Of course, filtering out signal from noise is a skill all by itself. Tall tales, baseless speculation and hearsay are common fodder for the various intelligence agencies, and it takes time to sift through everything.\n\nThe latest craze is a rumor that an influential politician from Gorky has travelled the wastes to reach Komi. Depicted as a natural political genius and charismatic orator by the rumor mill, few agree as to what this arrival means. The most popular conclusion is that Suslov, the far left's mastermind, is likely behind it."
 NIK.90.a:0 "Another communist power-player?"
 
 NIK.91.t:0 "The Rise of Ponomaryov"
 NIK.91.d:0 "As it turned out, the man from Gorky was not from Gorky after all! Boris Ponomaryov, as the man's name turned out to be, was born in Shakhovskoye. The small village in what was once Ulyanovsk Oblast, nowadays the KONR controlled Samara government, has another famous child in the form of Mikhail Suslov. An interesting coincidence, perhaps? Few in Komi's shaky democracy would believe this.\n\nWhatever his origins are, the charismatic Ponomaryov has been making the rounds. His speech lambasting the democratic coalition's unwillingness to deal with the far right have been popular through large swathes of the population. This newcomer rides on a wave of discontent, and is likely to be one of the prime communist candidates in the next elections."
 NIK.91.a:0 "Now, what do you hide...?"
 
 NIK.92.t:0 "The Veil"
 NIK.92.d:0 "A charismatic new communist candidate from Suslov's old stomping ground is too much of a coincidence for the democratic coalition's higher ups to swallow. Suslov's command of Komi's far left is ambiguous and hard to measure. Perhaps the slippery shadow might have made a pact with a charismatic front-man to enhance his control of the party?\n\nThe young republic's policemen would of course never stoop so low as to run private investigations on the enemies of the current government. But monitoring the coming and going of new political figures definitely falls somewhere in their priority list. Better, then, to run some background checks on this new figure."
 NIK.92.a:0 "We must pierce it!"
 NIK.92.b:0 "There is no point."
 
 NIK.93.t:0 "A Revelation"
 NIK.93.d:0 "The detectives were dismayed to find that in the end Ponomaryov was... terribly dull.\n\nA paper pusher in Suslov's foreign ministry during the West Russian War, Ponomaryov fell of the face of the earth during the ensuing collapse and anarchy. Not too surprising, as the front's disintegration had seen tons of people claim authority in those first few years of the anarchy.\n\nThe man reappeared a few year laters when the situation had stabilized. Through fragmented communication Ponomaryov had managed to reach out to his old boss Suslov. As the man still resided in the WRRF's territory, it seems that Komi's communist had told him to stay there as a liaison agent with the WRRF's officer clique. A few years passed before Suslov recalled him back home. Upon arrival in Komi's capital, Ponomaryov had begun his political efforts.\n\nOutside of his speeches, Ponomaryov was a terminally boring man. Nothing more than another Suslovite automaton it seemed.\n\nThe police continued their investigation. Perhaps a few more scraps of dirt could be gathered on him. For matters of state security, of course."
 NIK.93.a:0 "Just another puppet..."
 
 NIK.94.t:0 "The Trail Fades"
 NIK.94.d:0 "Ponomaryov's private life was filled with scandals, as it turned out. When drinking with his friends, he often skipped paying for his round of drinks. Last year, a terrible cold had left him stuck at home for a week, and rumor had it that a local young woman with pretty clothes had brought him soup for the week.\n\nWell, not terribly important scandals. The police investigators were running out of leads on him. And in Syktyvkar, being too nosy could always carry an unexpected price. The far left's counter-intelligence agencies had likely expected the police to come sniffing around their man. Pushing too hard would not be a good look for the supposedly impartial governmental officers.\n\nThe police thus ended its inquiry. Boris Ponomaryov was just another communist politician hopeful. The government had other business to tend to. Hopefully the newcomer was not dangerous."
 NIK.94.a:0 "This must be Suslov's doing!"
 
 NIK.95.t:0 "Increased Fascist Activity"
 NIK.95.d:0 "Komi's far right had always been a force to be reckoned with. Not as big as the government's democratic militias, nor as big as Suslov's web of far-left nogoodniks, the fascist militias had still maintained a respectable fighting strength. Drilling their men frequently and accumulating as many weapons as possible, the far right had earned their place as the third pillar of Komi's defense forces.\n\nFrom there, the fascist paramilitaries had adapted themselves well to the stalemate. They acquired a few quarters of the capital for their own purposes, and often clashed with democrats or communists. Their big break had been given to them by the government's recent battles with Suslov's forces. Under garrisoned communist or democratic districts had been taken over by the far right. Weapon convoys rolled between various fascist sectors as every area the far right got its hands on was reinforced by fresh militiamen.\n\nIn parallel to the military offensive had come a propaganda offensive. The democrat's pathetic attempt at crushing the decadent far left would come back to haunt Komi, the radio announcer claimed. Had the communist not squandered two opportunities to defeat the Germans already? The democratic coalition was impotent to stop the spread of the communist blight. Only hard men could manage these difficult times. The take over of new areas by fascist militias was only preventive, meant to save citizens from the communist menace. So went the far right's propaganda campaign."
 NIK.95.a:0 "Where one falls, another rises."
 
 NIK.96.t:0 "Left-Voznesentsi Threaten to Split!"
 NIK.96.d:0 "This is an outrage! Even as a rising tide of fascism threatens to drown the republic, the government insists on fighting the communist? Has President Voznesensky gone mad? Or is he merely capitulating to the fear mongers of the liberal and conservative party?"\n\nThe speech was booed by the majority of the democratic party. But a worrying percentage of the Social Democratic representatives cheered the speech. The majority of the Social Democrats' left wing had been grumbling for weeks now that the fascists were left free to rampage. Now the grumbling had ended and an openly mutinous feeling had swept through the left of the Voznesensti. Rumors of a motion to end the campaign on the far left had spread through the assembly. Worryingly, rumors of mass defections to the communists had also begun spreading. The social democrats were the biggest party of the ruling coalition. Yet the loss of the party's left wing would not be good for Voznesensky's party. A loss of the majority that allowed the coalition to rule the nation would likely follow, and with that the specter of a paralyzed government unable to deal with any crisis."
 NIK.96.a:0 "An absurd demand!"
 
 NIK.97.t:0 "A Hanging Thread?"
 NIK.97.d:0 "Voznesensky's party whips had been working overtime to put the fear of God into the mutineers. As it turned out, all this effort risked being for naught.\n\nAlarms were first raised when the social democrats' left wingers refused any attempt at compromise. Several representatives that had once been open to compromise with the center and center right had now turned into hardliners. No amount of threats, negotiations or bribes could coerce them back into line. The increasingly suspicious party whips turned to less official channels. The party members' phone lines were tapped, just as paramilitary agents tracked the mutineers every moves. Eventually a pattern began to emerge: almost half of the mutineers were receiving instructions directly from Suslov and his communists!\n\nThis development has turned the mutiny crisis into a looming catastrophe. The communists had planted a hard kernel of dissenters within the social democrats for just such an eventuality. As the social democrat's left wing is riddled with Suslovite agents and those gullible enough to follow them, it is impossible to negotiate with them. The government's loss of its majority has now become imminent."
 NIK.97.a:0 "Everyone is compromised!"
 
 NIK.98.t:0 "The Olive Branch"
 NIK.98.d:0 "Zhdanov felt a little apprehensive, writing his letter. There was always a thrill, a slight pang of fear upon jumping into the unknown. His partnership with Voznesensky had been friendly all these years. It had been comfortable to slowly build up the republic as well as develop its communist party. But now the movements of Gumilyov, Suslov and the democratic war hawks required Zhdanov to step up his own game. Thus, his declaration of war as a request for peace.\n\nPresident Voznesensky would receive a humble proposal of peace. Would it not be better if the enemies of reaction united their forces to smash the fascist paramilitaries? The end of the government's assault on the communist paramilitaries would prevent the fascist from gaining strength. It would also safeguard the left's own manpower, for Zhdanov enjoyed knowing the communists held significant firepower. One day, perhaps Suslov's grip would be wrenched away from the paramilitaries, and their ownership would transfer to Zhdanov? This development would have to wait, however. Before that would come the division of the democratic party, as the liberals and conservatives would lash out against the social democrats for letting the communists go free. Voznesensky would be a victim of his attempt to broker peace with the left.\n\nIn this regard, the president might choose to reject peace. It would be a clever move, and the president was a clever man. Voznesensky would never suspect that his old mentor and long time associate would dare burn up their partnership and reveal the president's ties to the left. Such a revelation would of course immensely hurt the president. But Zhdanov suspected he wouldn't even have to go this far. After all, that wily snake Suslov had many trump cards of his own. Better let Suslov engineer a collapse of the government. This way, Zhdanov would keep his very best cards for a few more turns. The winner of the game, after all, might very well be the last man to make a move."

The man imagined he had some level of functional cleverness if nothing else, for leading men on the battlefield required the ability to outthink the opponent as well as outfight him. Sure, Boris would never be a published author, but as the commander of one of the largest democratic paramilitaries he spent his days trying to stay one step ahead of the opposition in tactics and strategies.\n\nAfter days spent hammering communist positions and wracking his brain on how best to outflank various pockets of resistance, the commander couldn't understand where his new orders were coming from. The new word from central command was, all available forces were to stop their advances on the reds and whip around to smash the fascist paramilitaries.\n\nBoris began by verifying all of the messenger's credentials. Everything checked out, bizarrely. The orders themselves were written with the usual codes. A phone call to central headquarters confirmed this big switch in priorities. "We were on the brink of ending the communists. " the commander informed the messenger. Not as a reproach, but rather as a statement of facts. The messenger, a young man with a scraggly beard, nodded. Boris could see that his interlocutor, too, was confused by the switch of priorities. But orders were orders. 'twas not for Boris and his ilk to question them. The commander hoped his men would understand, lest things become mutinous."

Zhdanov had long exchanged information and other goodies with his partner as continuous proofs of good will. Now this trade would have to be cut back, to keep the pressure on. The usual methods of communication would also be adjusted, aside from a few emergency channels. Voznesensky would soon see that the old days of continuous access to one another were a thing of the past.\n\nThese few acts of housekeeping done, all Zhdanov could do was wait. He was fairly certain Suslov would come up with a solution to the current fruitless battle between the communists. Voznesensky was a fool if he thought the status quo could continue endlessly, in Komi's endless games of political espionage.

Worryingly, almost all were members of the left wing of Voznesensky's social democrats. Party whips were also conspicuously absent the entire morning. In the back corridors of the legislative assembly, the democratic faction's insiders exchanged urgent whispers about the situation.\n\nIn the afternoon the missing deputies came in after the lunch break. Without a word, the men and women of the assembly picked up their chairs and offices and dragged them to the communist side of the assembly. The rain of jeers and boos from their former democratic colleagues did nothing to hinder their progress. The far right and far left observed the situation carefully. A few communists exchanged written memos, but none spoke publicly. Once the commotion was dealt with and order was restored to the assembly, the democratic coalition's majority no longer existed. While neither the communists nor the fascists made a big case of it, the government now lived on borrowed time. At any moment a vote of no confidence could go through to bring down the previously impervious democratic coalition."

The gas flames licked the kettle, rendering it red hot in the badly lit communal kitchen. Inside the steel kettle, pressure was rising to a fevered pitch.\n\nThe abandon of the Social Democratic party by its left wing had brought Komi's fragile status quo to the brink. Now pressure was welling up within the legislative assembly as the democratic coalition desperately searched for a pathway to a new majority. Zhdanov had not heard of Voznesensky since the sudden betrayal. It was not difficult to imagine where the president's mind was at the moment. Rage at being undercut by the communists. Anguish at the thought of his ties with Zhdanov coming to light. Now might be the best moment for Zhdanov to push against the President, to weaken him further before the left could bring a final breakdown of the coalition. By threatening a full reveal of their connection, Zhdanov could try to extract some concession or another, such as a tax free communist district. This would further weaken the President and estrange him from his allies. But the communist politician knew that Voznesensky was a proud man, and was equally likely to resist any further attempt at blackmail. That might prove another worthwhile scenario, for if the president refused further cooperation with Zhdanov he might not live the week politically. Zhdanov surmised that the social democrat's allies would not remain allies for long of a president that had brought their government to the abyss.\n\nThe kettle's whistle brought Zhdanov out of his reverie. Yes, his former protege was stuck in a pressure chamber of his own making. The least that Zhdanov could do was to bring him out of it at the first opportunity...

Most enraged of all were his allies in the democratic coalition: the remaining social democrats, suddenly realizing the cause of their party's downfall; Shafarevich's conservatives, our erstwhile allies, unnerved by the idea of communists worming their way into the government; and most of all Kosygin's liberals, livid at the betrayal. The chief of the liberal party has gone on the warpath upon hearing of the leaks, promising a vote of no-confidence to oust the traitor president. Any protest that doing so would hand a significant amount of power to the communist have been brushed aside by Kosygin and his allies.

In disgrace, Voznesensky saw his presidency revoked and was forced to cede power to Kosygin, his former second in command. Komi's constitution is quite clear about the chain of succession for executive power. The downfall of Voznesensky means the ascension of Kosygin.\n\nIf book makers weren't sure about betting on the downfall of the former President, money is already being put on the lifespan of the new presidency. For all his energetic speech urging the removal of Voznesensky, Kosygin has not given any response to those who worry about the fragility of the democratic coalition. Shorn of the social democrat's left wing, and with his contempt of the communists on display, the new president must quickly find a way of stabilizing his political backing, lest the same fate befalls him.\n\nhis political reputation as a neutral leader of order and stability destroyed, and his political party collapsing, Voznesensky's political career is finished.

Yes, Voznesensky has proven to be an enemy of the common worker... But Kosygin has done nothing but encourage the democratic coalition to ramp up the war against the left. The communist leaders thus left individual members of parliament free to vote. As such a surprising grouping of deputies have let Voznesensky cling to power.\n\nThe leader of the liberal party has answered with a speech about the ignominy of staying in power through fascist and communist votes. Kosygin has urged vigilance to all members of the democratic coalition, lest radical agenda slip through Voznesensky's presidential orders. In a speech of his own, a visibly shaken Voznesensky has thanked the republic for its continued confidence in him. The President went on to urge cooperation in these difficult time.

His old mentor had now turned into a merciless jailor. What choice did the president have but collaboration with Zhdanov?

Many politicized youths join the army to learn the art of violence, only to seek further employment in the militias after their tour of service. Others join the army in between stints in the streets of the capital, often to let the heat die down after a recent militia clash.\n\nToday a group of communist leaning soldiers have announced an unlimited strike to protest the government's violence against the far left. "Why has the government gone back on its words and broken the truce with the communist parties? Why are noble men of the republican army sent to die for political bickerings?" asked the speakers to assembled soldiers. A chorus of indignation lifted up the question, as policemen observed the public protest.\n\nNumbers are still coming in, but it seems that our initial guess that one third of the army has communist leanings has proven accurate. Down to sixty-six percent of its usual strength, and with all of its tank corps joining the strike, our army has been badly hit by this strike."

Attempts by communist paramilitaries to support the strikers were fought off violently. After a day of bloody battles, the strikers were dishonorably discharged and sent home without pay.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this has hurt the communist in any real way, as the soldiers have simply flooded into their old paramilitary units. The tanks themselves have rolled away from the army bases and into their storage depots near the communist headquarters. No attempt was made to prevent this, the government fearing rampaging tankers turning their guns on Syktyvkar's buildings.

These protests have been drowned out in turn by a tidal wave of outrage from parties ranging from social democrats to the far right. "The communists thugs have deserted their posts in this hour of need" pointed out a fascist deputy, to a mixture of applause and jeers.\n\nThe fascist paramilitaries are known to maintain their own strict standards of training and obedience.

The government's protest that this has proven out to be an unworkable deal in the long run has fallen on deaf ears. These new soldiers insist they are loyal to the government, and consider their demands for more autonomy as a proof of trust of the government in them.\n\nGovernmental intelligence sources have tried to decipher the far right's communication. Many higher-ups of the democratic coalition suspect Lev Gumilyov, shadow master of the far right to be behind this recent agitation.

And through all this, the regiment's officers were slowly being shuffled around. An apolitical colonel decided on an early retirement. His replacement was a well known ultra-nationalist. Little by little, the grievances of the former paramilitaries simply went away, solved on their own by the military command's bureaucracy.\n\nDemocratic politicians are now pouring resources into the issue. Has the far right penetrated the military's high command? Or as it simply been a case of Gumilyov spreading bribes to get things to go his way?

Now that his supporters hold a non trivial position in the republican army, Shafarevich's political star, as tainted as it is by his associated to Gumilyov, has risen sharply.\n\nHis temporary partners in the democratic coalition have not reacted much to this new reality, as the military is, supposedly, a politically neutral organization. However, in Komi a ministerial reshuffle is never far away, and a new conservative ministry might go a long way toward reaching out to the government's new partner.\n\nCommunist politicians, on the other hand, have not been happy to see the rightists gain new supporters. Rumors on the left is that the so-called 'traditional democratic' militias are secretly filled with fascist and Gumilyovites.

However, what he did not expect was just how popular Bukharina's ideas would be. Not only did it appeal to those in the Communist Party, but to a surprising amount of those outside the party as well. She leveraged her influence very well, it seemed. Such an opportunity could not be wasted, as the party always needed more influence in its struggle against the right and the center. More resources would have to be moved to the "legitimate" side of politics, which meant more could be invested towards supporting Bukharina.\n\nSuslov leaned back in his chair, sipping his tea.

Ponomaryov, ever the loyal sycophant, had reported to him as he had on all other nights one stormy evening; but when Suslov asked him about Svetlana Bukharina, the hesitation before he spoke, dismissing her as a threat and suggesting Suslov should turn his eyes elsewhere? More than that, Ponomaryov disagreed with his assessment of a threat?\n\nThat was alarming.\n\nIt was clear the man was compromised, likely accepting some bribe or promise of power by Bukharina. The thought made Suslov's blood curl - this wasn't Bukharin's runt's party - it was Suslov's.\n\nSuslov prepared for the inevitable.

Despite his best efforts, he'd come to be familiar with most of the cast of characters commonly depicted on such posters. And when the chill winds of early autumn began to sweep down onto Syktyvkar from the Arctic Circle, it all became impossible to ignore, as every last scrap of paper in the street was set loose into the air in a blizzard of political propaganda. Thus, he couldn't help but notice one day, when all of the red paper swirling through the streets was adorned with the face of a man he'd never seen before."

 NIK.124.t:0 "Zhdanov's Ascension"
 NIK.124.d:0 "A sea of grey and drab brown blanketed the lone ballroom of Syktyvkar's sole respectable hotel. For the sixth straight year, it had been the site not only of the political conventions of the right-wingers and Voznesentsy, but also the Communists, whose turn it was today to use the space. Because of this, the place was almost universally assumed to be bugged. Of course, no one wanted to actually admit this, since any party's leveling of this allegation would be immediately met by a litany of their own misdeeds, so it was generally in everyone's interest to handle all public matters in the ballroom and do all the actual negotiating in the vacant lot behind the hotel.\n\nThe sharp clap of a worn gavel brought the room to order as Mikhail Suslov walked onstage, taking his place at a podium in the center of a long table of allegedly important party figures. Of course, Suslov had put almost every single one of them there, and had a means to keep them in line. Which is precisely what made his current task so irritating.\n\n"Comrades, I am pleased to announce that the Komi Communist Party's candidate for the upcoming elections is Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov." Loud applause and a few cheers rippled across the crowd as the stocky, mustached man walked up the aisle, sporting his best equivalent of a smile - really more of a cheerful grimace. Suslov exchanged a quick handshake with Zhdanov onstage, and, feigning enthusiasm, went on for a few minutes about how bright the party's future was under their new candidate. Inside, of course, Suslov's feelings were quite different. He had built this organization up from nothing, and everyone who had a position here had it because he allowed it. And as he stepped back and watched Zhdanov work the crowd, Suslov knew this had to be nipped in the bud before it grew out of control. The fact that both men privately agreed on a number of doctrinal issues made no difference. Either Zhdanov would learn to bend the knee, or he would have to be driven out. There was simply no alternative. And Suslov wouldn't have it any other way."

Suslov barely took notice, dispensing two cups' worth of tea from the samovar in the corner and lighting a practically-ancient oil lamp.\n\n"Svetlana Nikolaevna," he intoned, "Your name carries a great deal of importance in this party. Your father, for all his flaws -"\n\n"Mikhail, while I appreciate the flattery," Bukharina said coolly. "I know you haven't called me here to talk about my family name."\n\nSuslov smiled, as if his guest had lived up to his expectations. "Comrade Bukharina," he began. "I don't suppose my displeasure at Zhdanov's nomination escaped your notice, did it?"\n\n"Displeasure is one way to put it, I suppose."\n\nSuslov continued. "Zhdanov has his sights on me and the political order I have created. What I am asking of you is to work with me to keep him in line." Bukharina eyed him warily, not reacting. "I'm not going to speak in terms of personal loyalty or ideology – I know you, and you know me. We both want power, pure and simple. I wouldn't be surprised if Zhdanov has already made some sort of proposal to you, and if he hasn't, he will soon."\n\n"And?"\n\n"I'd simply like to reiterate what should be a self-evident truth: Zhdanov will dispose of you and your kith and kin the instant I am gone. The man desires-"\n\n"You dare to suggest that you're any different?"\n\n"Svetlana Nikolaevna, you know how I operate." Suslov paused, sipping tea. "I don't lead from the front. Why do you think you've gotten this far in a party with this much anti-Bukharinite sentiment? Goodwill alone? Your family name? I need people at my side."\n\nInternally, Bukharina had to acknowledge he was right, at least in part. She had been the recipient of Suslov's patronage time and time again.\n\n"So what you're saying is that I have a choice between being a puppet under you and dead under Zhdanov."\n\n"Cruder terminology than I would have used, but directionally correct, Comrade Bukharina. You have a simple choice." Suslov lit a cigarette. "Stay the course and continue your meteoric and unexpected rise to power, or throw away everything that has gotten you this far for the privilege of being executed by our dear friend Andrei.""

Come in, sit down."\n\n"Then you're a very smart woman indeed," Zhdanov noted with obvious insincerity, declining to take a seat but closing the door behind him. "I've come to talk to you about the snake in our midst. The serpent wrapped around the heart of this Party–"\n\n"I get it. What exactly do you want?" Svetlana responded.\n\n"It's nothing personal against Suslov," Zhdanov continued, his tone now emphatic and frank. "It's just that this party could be run much more efficiently without that rat's lackeys clogging up the machinery. We could do something great, Svetlana. You and I, together, at the helm. Without him breathing down our necks."\n\nBukharina looked back, unconvinced.\n\n"Specifics, Andrei. When, where, and what?"\n\n"There are no specifics yet. Things are... still up in the air. Keep your ear to the ground. You'll hear from me when it's time."\n\n"The hell am I supposed to do with that?"\n\n"Think, Svetlana, think. You can't live as Suslov's pawn forever–"\n\n"That's an awfully bold statement from someone asking for help," Svetlana noted with a not-so-subtle hint of tactically-induced irritation.\n\n"I can hear it in your voice, Bukharina. You know it's true."\n\n"Our relationship is hardly one of dependence and subordination," Bukharina countered calmly, her voice suddenly placid and professional. "Nonetheless, your offer will be taken under consideration."\n\n"A solid choice. We'll be in touch." With that, Zhdanov was gone."

Even Voznesensky's office was something of a wreck, with countless economic charts and graphs pinned to the wall with a variegated array of metal pushpins and other sharp objects.\n\nYet Voznesensky's demeanor could not have been more to the contrary. Although he scarcely cut an authoritative figure in his plaid sport-coat and bow tie, he nonetheless carried the serene, softly dominant aura of a Persian satrap, watching his numerous aides and underlings with a dispassionate eye.\n\n"Nikolai, I thought we would be speaking privately," Zhdanov said with slight irritation.\n\n"My apologies for the dust, Andrei. The upcoming elections have our headquarters in...disarray," Voznesensky explained. "Only physically, of course," he quickly added. Zhdanov's host motioned to an adjacent, empty, conference room. Voznesensky waited until his guest was seated to direct the conversation to the nebulous "business" Zhdanov was so keen to discuss in private.\n\n"To put it simply, Nikolai," Zhdanov said, "I'm asking for your backing in the settling of a political score." These words alone didn't take Voznesensky by surprise, it was the name that came next that did. Mikhail goddamned Suslov.\n\n"With all due respect, Andrei...I don't see how this concerns our party. All concerns of practicality or wisdom aside, this is an internal matter for your party. Suslov's goons are a non-entity for us."\n\n"You're very quick to deny the existence of half of your own party's membership," Zhdanov shot back in a retort he'd been practicing in his head for longer than he really wanted to admit. A half-second later, his host acknowledged him with an eye-roll.\n\n"Do I really need to list the reasons your party would benefit from taking Suslov out of the equation?"\n\nVoznesensky was much too self-conscious to respond verbally, but nodded with understanding.\n\n"What kind of support are you looking for?""

Except in this case, neither was an angel, and both were probably lying.\n\nThe phone rang a second time.\n\nSuslov, on the one hand, was arguably the safe bet. He was, after all, the puppetmaster of the whole Republic. But the red maestro's sickeningly self-assured words gnawed at her.\n\n"Directionally correct."\n\nAs much as she hated to acknowledge it, Zhdanov was not entirely wrong, and, despite her better impulses, his words had gotten to her. The fact remained that, if she was to ever take the helm of the Komi state, Suslov would have to be gone. A man like him could not be brought to heel or compromised with. He had to be broken, and on that level, Zhdanov's words had some value.\n\nThe phone rang a third time.\n\nOf course, Bukharina could not forget the fact that anything coming out of Zhdanov's mouth was almost certain to bare venomous fangs at her sooner or later. Even compared to the two-faced bureaucrats of Komi, Zhdanov had always displayed a truly disturbing level of comfort with falsehood and deceit. In the bizarre political mirror-universe that was the Komi Republic, an offer of an alliance from Zhdanov was perhaps best considered a florid threat.\n\nSvetlana Bukharina, however, was well acquainted with danger.

And, as the actors launched into a rousing chorus with a crescendo of the theater's antique organ, the creaking of steps announced the presence of a visitor for Suslov, the Red Eminence of Komi.\n\nIt certainly wasn't a world-class performance of Boris Godunov that was being put on, Svetlana Bukharina mused as she climbed the rickety stairs to the Komi Grand Theater's lone luxury box parting a thin miasma of bluish cigarette smoke\n\n"To what do I owe the honor, Svetlana Nikolaevna?" Suslov intoned, his voice barely audible over the opera's musical clamor.\n\nBukharina did not respond, letting the tramp of further footsteps on the stairs and a stern look do the talking for her. Six armed paramilitaries filed in behind her as the orchestra below unknowingly sounded a requiem for Komi's puppetmaster.\n\nAnd as his bodyguards shot him a look of sad resignation and holstered their weapons, Suslov knew that this time, he'd been outmaneuvered.\n\n"Comrade General Secretary," Bukharina began curtly, "I'm not going to mince words. I am demanding your resignation."\n\n"On what grounds?"\n\n"Participation in a bourgeois conspiracy against the Party."\n\n"Denied." Suslov took a drag on his cigarette and forced a chuckle, regaining a bit of his confidence. He gestured to the militiamen. "I'll be honest, Svetlana, I expected better of you. Run along, now."\n\nSvetlana gritted her teeth."Then I'll have to place you under arrest-"\n\n"Under whose authority?"\n\n"Mine," hissed a voice from the stairwell. Andrei Zhdanov stepped into the box, flanked by Semichastny and Voytukevich.\n\n"My, you people are quite efficient," remarked Suslov, verbally backtracking as he tried to buy time. But age had taken its toll. He had nowhere to run, no backup plan. His bodyguards had been paid off. He fumbled at his pants, trying to draw the pistol he barely knew how to use, but the advancing militiamen were faster, tackling him to the ground and sending his gun clattering across the floor.\n\nSvetlana let a slight smile cross her face.

Putting a bullet in my skull only means Zhdanov will put one in yours," Suslov said, a snarl creeping its way into his voice.\n\n"That's none of your concern, Comrade General Secretary," Bukharina shot back, pulling a silk dress glove out of her pocket and slipping it on her right hand.\n\nAt the same time, the militiamen pulled the handcuffed Suslov upright. Despite the blood running from his nose and the grime on his suit, Svetlana had to admit that Suslov still cut a striking figure as he examined his captor with disdain.\n\n"So exactly what am I under arrest for, your majesty?" Suslov sneered. "Betraying the party isn't a crime under the laws of the republic-"\n\n"Don't you even start with that," Bukharina scolded. "You've been in this godforsaken town for long enough to know exactly how our justice system works, and who it works for."\n\n"I shouldn't have expected much from the product of Nikolai fucking his own secretary," Suslov hissed.\n\nBukharina bent over and slid her prisoner's gun into her gloved hand. Suslov's eyes widened with fear as she raised it, racking the slide. Pandemonium erupted in the box as Suslov writhed at his handcuffs, shouting breathlessly while Bukharina's men pulled Zhdanov back towards the railing. The lead soloist launched into an aria, the orchestral accompaniment resounding throughout the hall. Semichastny shouted something, holding his boss back, both helplessly adrift in the ruins of their own plan.\n\nWithout so much as a word, Svetlana glanced over her shoulder at Zhdanov and put a bullet in her co-conspirator's head."

His demands to know the soldiers' business were rebuffed with silence as the cell bars were cut out with a hand saw.

He felt his stomach tighten into a visceral, convulsive knot of animal panic as the realization dawned on him\n\nThis is how it all ends.\n\nAs he was unceremoniously dumped on the wet grass, his last, panicked thoughts were of his wife and the Party\n\nNo one heard the gunshots."

Now, all of the city is more informed on what this civilization truly is."

 NIK.148.t:0 "A History of Our Republic"
 NIK.148.d:0 "One of the most well-known authors in the Komi Republic, Viktor Smirnov, who is in fact an ethnic Komi, has recently released one of his most popular books, "A History of our Republic". The book details the history of modern Komi, from the creation of the autonomous territories by the Soviet Union, to its role as part of the WRRF, until its modern state. The author has in fact lived through almost this entire era, and as such had a first-hand experience that helped him write the book.\n\nCritics have acclaimed the book, which combines elements of historical literature with Smirnov's own experiences throughout his life in a way appealing to all readers. The History of the Republic has skyrocketed in popularity days within its release among both ethnic Rusians and natives. The Komi themselves also appear to be satisfied with the image presented, and point to the modern problems mentioned as well as the need for equality and respect from their co-patriots.\n\nThe question is, aside from the clear cultural impact and legacy such a popular book will leave in the Republic, if there will possibly be any political implications. Smirnov himself has clearly stated he is not affiliated with any of the myriads of political organizations operating in the nation, and is independent. Of course, not all believe that, but for the most part, "A History of Our Republic" appears to be nothing more than an insight into the history of the natives that play such an important role in this nation."

 NIK.149.d:0 "One inevitability of Komi's politics is that the status quo will change radically, at a moment's notice. The sadness of this factor, however, is that, at the moment, the status quo seems to be shifting radically away from the ruling Voznesensti faction.\n\nLike it or not, by simple virtue of being the public face of the democratic factions in the Republic, public support has been eroded by scandal after scandal, be they real or constructed by our political enemies. Public support, ever fleeting and ephemeral, has, as of late, been shifting either to the Suslovite extreme left, or the more moderate liberal and conservative factions - those of our coalition partners.\n\nAs our coalition seems to undergo a period of self-restructuring, it is critical to ensure that political capital is more or less maintained by the ruling party, and that the current President isn't challenged too heavily by our own allies. Whether the solution to this is limiting our most credible coalition partner, or simply standing by and letting our power shrivel away, is entirely up to the whims of the President."

It's always good to keep a little contrast with conversational partners, in any case. Helps with the banter. Not that there's much to talk about these days, besides the endless politics of the Republic. Teacup arrangements as the storm of Russia rages on around them.\n\n"Do you miss the old days, then? Svetlana?" Before he's quite ready the words leave his mouth, to his mild regret.\n\nStalina's face stays closed. She looks at her tea, a twitch flicking across her otherwise controlled features.\n\n"I wouldn't say so, no. The past is a different time."\n\n"Different, but rosier than the present. I certainly won't miss the days of fighting over bills when this is all over."\n\n"Oh, Nikolai. This isn't fighting, this is just...my father used to call it war without war. And look where we've gotten this Republic, by fighting this hard. How far we've come. If this is how democracy works, I'll stick by it."\n\nStalina smiles, almost wolfish. "And I know you, you old fox - you like it here as much as I do. You'd die without the next bill to argue down or to push up."\n\nVosnesensky laughs back at her. "You truly do know me. Perhaps I have still underestimated you, hm, Stalina? Yes, perhaps there is health left in this place - even if this old fox dies, Komi will struggle to breathe.""

Those with a little more composure hold the sobbing townsfolk and the screaming widow away from the scene. (If she wasn't a widow before, she is certainly a widow now.)\n\nOfficer Popov takes a whiff of his cigarette, hacking as his fingers tremble. He's waiting for someone, and that someone is late. Lateness is not a quality the Vosnesensky Brigade (Irregular) appreciates. As the distant screams recede, his acquaintance swims into view. Grabbing irritably at the dust on his lapels, Commander Koslov makes his way to the burning frontage. He kicks aside a brick, nods briskly, and the two are down to business.\n\n"There is little to discuss, Popov." The Commander glares into the distance, pointing southeast of the duo's position. "You shoot two men here, we kill a couple more. We'll do the same this time next week."\n\n"Not what I was talking about. We're hitting those fucking Bolshies in our own neighbourhoods, so what about the others?" Popov is venomous, his searing gaze directed towards all of Communism, or perhaps it is focused on Koslov. "We need to spread out. This does nothing for the health of the Republic."\n\nKoslov brushes his ragged beard. His men will gladly go where there is game to be had, but control is thin enough in this district as it is. Is it worth the expenditure? Will their paymasters in the Parliament be happy? He shrugs. It will, in the end, be him who decides, not some waistsuited corpse. Democracy is built on the ground in Komi, even when it is built bullet by bullet."

But it was indoor, it wasn't in ruins, and the staff mostly kept the attending guests fed with a steady stream of passable food and piping hot tea.\n\nDelegates from all of the coalition's parties could be seen. Chief among them were Voznesensky's colleagues in the social democrat party and Kosygin's social liberals, the twin pillar of the democratic coalition. Present less in a political quality, and more in their role as important bureaucrats and power brokers of the coalition were members of the democratic government, such as police officers, bureaucrats and paramilitary bosses. These institutions member tended to gather around Stalina and her increasingly influential PSD party. The rising star of the democratic coalition drew much attention and courtesy visits from both other democratic parties.

This gift of freedom and peace, of a place where we can help one another to rebuild our fractured nation, this gift of democracy enduring and untarnished, this gift is one I ardently wish to protect. As this assembly proceeds with the election of a candidate for the presidential elections, I stress to all gathered today: debate the merits of each presidential hopeful. But once a candidate for our coalition is chosen, I implore you to follow them without hesitation. The unity of our coalition is one of our strongest weapons against the radicals that seek to bring our republic to an early end.

After the customary round of thanks to the assembly, and the congratulations given to Voznesensky and Stalina for their efforts in the coalition, Kosygin reached the heart of his speech.\n\n"The Germans have squandered the wealth of their nation in fuel and bombs for a terror bombing campaign that has accomplished very little. Now, the frequency of bombings dwindles by the day. Rumors coming from Moskowien detail the upcoming collapse of the Reich. My friends, once the German planes are gone we shall be free to rebuild. We've kept hope all these years. Our childrens were taught as best as possible. Our homes were cleaned of debris where possible. Now that the terror bombing campaign is ending, the reconstruction of Russia can begin. New factories, new schools, new courthouses, new churches. The republic's citizens are strong and hardworking. A new republic is within reach." Kosygin paused. "It is my belief that this republic can re-unite Russia. Chosen as candidate for our esteemed coalition, and elected president of the Republic, I vow to dedicate all my energy to a new Russian nation able to house generations upon generations. Our cause is just, and it shall take us to the Pacific sea in the east... And to Moscow and St. Petersburg in the west. Thank you.""

His energetic and driven way of approaching any topic had helped him lead his nation throughout a range of issues, and his particular way of speaking had its usual effect on the assembly of making everyone in the audience captivated.\n\n"Honorable members of the assembly, thank you for your presence. Thank you a million times for your support, for it was by your help that I could become president, and it was through your continued support that our coalition government has safeguarded Komi's citizens these past few years. I call once again upon your support for my nomination as presidential candidate. The republic stands at a crossroad, as shadowy figures emerge to the forefront of Komi's politics. Several sets of long planned intrigues are reaching their conclusion , and their impact on the Republic promises to be an unmitigated disaster. I request a new mandate to continue the struggle against the snakes that wish to usurp our institutions. Stalina was right in denouncing the group of rabble rousers that spread their poison into the veins of our parliamentary system. The time to strike is almost upon us; in a new mandate I would bring down the might of the legal system upon those who scheme the nation's destruction. Our institutions can, and must, be reinforced so that no matter the amount of muck thrown by our opponents into its working, our republic will live on to bring our people to a bright future.""

Now, these anarchists have begun causing large amounts of damage and conflicts between the agitators and police have grown.\n\nThe leftist paramilitaries have even gone as far as preemptively declaring the election as rigged, even though not every vote has not even been counted. This has hurt the legitimacy of our elections, as it appears we are deliberately trying to secure our power. Whether this has any impact on our government remains to be seen.\n\nOur police continue to try and keep the violence at a minimum, but it appears the violence will only keep growing until the elections are over and the government secures its power."

Now, these militias have begun causing large amounts of violence, and conflicts with paramilitaries and police have begun to spiral out of control.\n\nThe rightists are also declaring the election as rigged, even though the election is not yet over.

No extremist has any chance to be elected peacefully and democratically. But our government must tread carefully, the leftists and their rightist counterparts now only have a stronger reason to pursue power with more violent means.\n\nStill, with our majority, we are free to pursue our agenda much more easily than if we had to cooperate with any radicals.

 NIK.181.t:0 "Uniting the Party"
 NIK.181.d:0 "It had been done. The Komi Republic was no longer under the control of shaky coalitions and governments guaranteed to fall, but under the strong and wise leadership of the Left. And, thankfully for Boris Ponomaryov, he was at its helm. Being the General Secretary of the party, by extension he could be considered the effective leader of Komi. However, many knew that in reality, Suslov was the true puppet master, the one truly in control.\n\nGaining the full trust and support from the entire Left was not as easy as one may think, for the movement had to face factionalism around its most powerful leaders. More specifically, Ponomaryov considered the two largest factions he could approach in his search to stabilize his rule: one was the followers of Svetlana Bukharina, the daughter of the former Soviet leader, that seemed to be asserting her position as an actor independent of Suslov. Another faction he could ally with was the supporters of Zhdanov; he seemed to be aiming for a socialist alternative, and had a significant following. Of course, he could stay far from both, but allying either one could give him the influence he needed."
 NIK.181.a:0 "Ask for more support from Suslov."
 NIK.181.b:0 "Zhdanov is more approachable these days."

 NIK.182.t:0 "The Connections"
 NIK.182.d:0 "Zhdanov was in his office when he learnt of the rendezvous with the new figurehead of the country, Ponomaryov. While he had some reservations about him, he was still a leftist, and perhaps he could secure a position of power by supporting him.\n\nA few hours later, the new General Secretary entered Zhdanov's office. Quickly, he got to the point of why he was there in the first place. "I am well aware of the role you played in Voznesensky's democratic government some time ago, and I am sure you gathered ... important lessons from that, as well as made some friendships with your former "allies." For the good of the republic, could you perhaps contact them, and maybe make some deals or remind them of earlier favours you had done for them? We could use some more loyalty by this nation's army."\n\nZhdanov looked hesitant at first, but quickly realized the opportunity this presented. His reply was short: "Of course, Comrade Ponomaryov. I'll see what I can do for you." Minutes later, the General Secretary left, and Zhdanov quickly picked up the phone. He had a lot of convincing to do."
 NIK.182.a:0 "Pull some more strings."
 NIK.182.b:0 "This, of course, is not our first priority."

 NIK.183.t:0 "Zhdanov's Pride"
 NIK.183.d:0 ""Yes, I understand perfectly - no, do not apologise, we are such good friends, after all. Of course the honorable Ponyomarov would benefit from raising the issue of Party Discipline in the Assembly. I believe it is to both our interests that the cause of the People be furthered, yes?" Zhdanov nodded, his trademark grin never leaving his face - it wasn't going to help him over the phone, but it helped put him in the right frame of mind.\n\n"It's been such a pleasure talking with you. Thank you, thank you again, and I hope you have a wonderful evening." As Zhdanov put down the phone, his grin flickered as if changing telescope lenses - from one frame to another entirely, while somehow the essence of the whole remained. He turned to Boris Nikolayevich Ponyamorov, standing besides him in a mirror of false affability. "It's done, comrade Ponyamorov."\n\n"As ever, I am thankful for your honesty and your dedication to serving the Republic's aims." The aims of Ponyamorov, they both meant without ever quite saying it. "Comrade Zhdanov, for such a gracious offer on my behalf I would like to offer something in return."\n\n"Oh, I could not possibly - we are both public servants here."\n\nPonyamorov leaned closer, and Zhdanov could smell the cigarette breath on his face. "I know," he whispered. "You will have what you want - I will lean in your direction." Chuckling at his discomfiture, he waved at Zhdanov, grabbed his coat and left. He'd won this round.\n\nZhdanov nodded slowly. A pawn for a bishop - a few more of these and dominance would be within reach. Taking his seat, he began to plan."
 NIK.183.a:0 "Well, we got what we wanted."

 NIK.184.t:0 "An Indiscretion?"
 NIK.184.d:0 "Boris Ponomaryov looked worried when he heard from Zhdanov for the first time since he asked him the big favor, to look into his connections to bring the military to he side of the regime. And the news were unsurprisingly negative.\n\nIt appears that the former allies and friends of Zhdanov are hesitant to support the socialists. Whether it is a personal rivalry, their alienation by the coup that betrayed the democratic ideals they stood up for, or simply their hatred of the Left, very few have voiced their endorsement of Ponomaryov and Suslov. Therefore, this effort has been considered a failure by the upper echelons of the clique in power.\n\nAs if this failure is not enough, more problems have appeared. These military and police commanders, who appear to still fiercely maintain their loyalty to the Center, have begun completely disobeying the orders they are given by the governing committee. Some refuse to fight insurgents and keep their units far from conflict, while some democrats in the police have ignored commands to arrest or execute specific political opponents. It seems the favour from Zhdanov has only backfired."
 NIK.184.a:0 "Unofrtunate."

 NIK.185.t:0 "Repurposing the Institutions"
 NIK.185.d:0 "When he was to present his genius plan in front of the committee of members of the Left Coalition, including Premier Suslov, Ponomaryov believed he had thought everything through, and that this action could provide a solution to many of the problems the newly formed government was facing.\n\n"What we need to realize is how useful the bureaucrats of the Republic can be. If you think about it, they do most of the actual, practical work, and are the ones who manage and run much of the smaller parts of the country, like gears in a large machine. However, deep down, they are all workers. Workers who must be awarded by the socialist system that works for their benefit. Thus, we need to show them how beneficial the new state can be. If we make them promises of increased pay, better work conditions, and everything else we stride for, then surely they will show their support for our side, and stabilizing our control will be much easier."\n\nInitially, many of Ponomaryov's allies were skeptical about the idea, as in their minds the bureaucracy was a remnant of the bourgeoisie that had to go away with it. However, it was an intriguing option to secure their rule. With some more convincing, the project was given the green light."
 NIK.185.a:0 "We can trust them."
 NIK.185.b:0 "We can't do this."

 NIK.186.t:0 "A Compromise with the Establishment"
 NIK.186.d:0 "In the end, the largest part of the complex bureaucracy running the Republic behind the scenes, and executing any order Syktyvkar gives them, has agreed to cooperate with the Socialists in running the country.\n\nSome communists found it disheartening that, as they said, "the revolutionaries have made a compromise with the bourgeoisie", but most have been pragmatic enough to realize the importance of this move. With most organizations and institutions throughout Komi under the influence of the government, we can use them to further our goals and expand our influence. Additionally, we have secured the support of another fraction of the population by delivering on our original promises to help the working people of the country. While it may have hurt the situation of the government, which will have to increase the payments and give some bonuses to the bureaucrats, in the end, it will be beneficial."
 NIK.186.a:0 "Excellent."

 NIK.187.t:0 "Backstabbed!"
 NIK.187.d:0 "The recent news regarding the effort to gain the support of the bureaucrats are bleak. Initially, the results of the talks with presidents and chairmen of institutions of the Republic seemed promising, and as long as we gave some significant concessions, we could possibly secure their loyalty. However, small issues began to appear, and it seems that in the end, the vast majority of the bureaucracy is opposed to our policies, and even if we give them better work conditions, they refuse to support us. It seems that this is a lost cause, and there is no reason to continue with the agenda."
 NIK.187.a:0 "We should never have compromised!"

 NIK.188.t:0 "Mistrust Abounds"
 NIK.188.d:0 "When Ponomaryov suggested the idea of appealing to the bureaucracy in search of a stable base of support in governing, no one expected for things to go this badly. Officials of the communist party have been conducting negotiations with leading members of the bureaucracy day and night for the last few days. Finding a deal that satisfies both sides has been incredibly difficult, and things were only further complicated yesterday, when the bureaucrats simply walked out of the negotiations, and refuse to cooperate with the authorities.\n\nNow, chaos and confusion dominates Syktyvkar and all levels of government in the country, as no one is quite sure what to do. We are desperately trying to salvage the situation as best as we can, but any success is unlikely. At the same time, many high-profile office-holders have resigned from their positions in reaction to these recent developments, and others are simply ignoring our authority. Let's hope this situation will be resolved as quickly as possible."
 NIK.188.a:0 "Damnation!"

 NIK.189.t:0 "Locking Down the City"
 NIK.189.d:0 "The capital of Komi was in complete lockdown ever since the first tanks left their positions to take control of the city in the name of the Left. No one could get in, and no one could get out. It was that simple, but the arrival of a small wave of refugees would complicate the situation. It was not just one large caravan, but many different ones, each coming from elsewhere. Some were coming from the north, some from the south, and some from Moskowien. Initially, they met the loyal garrisons of the Left, situated in the periphery of Syktyvkar to guard it from any possible incursions or threats. Of course, being in the middle of a coup, they were denied access. But some have resorted to more extreme means.\n\nWith only the key points around the city guarded, there have been "holes" in the security of the lockdown, and the refugees have used this to their advantage. Sneaking under forest cover or jumping over fences and barriers, many have entered the capital, desperately seeking to find shelter. The military does not seem to have this under control. What will our course of action be?"
 NIK.189.a:0 "Lock them in!"
 NIK.189.b:0 "Let them out!"

 NIK.190.t:0 "트로이 목마"
 NIK.190.d:0 "Perhaps our lack of action regarding the latest refugees to ask for shelter in Syktyvkar has been a mistake. Several reports from the city outskirts have shown that, in the end, these were not innocent civilians. Apparently, many of them are affiliated with Centrist and Rightist paramilitaries and insurgency groups, and have begun to aid them in the effort to overthrow the recently established socialist government.\n\nWe had believed that our forces had managed to secure the capital, by defeating the vast majority of the enemy troops in battle or disarming them. However, some holdouts continue their operations, and these refugees have immediately moved to help them in their mission. This has evolved into a major crisis, as we are currently in risk of completely losing control to the resurging militias. The socialist government is considering the options it has right now."
 NIK.190.a:0 "우리가 그렇게 자비롭게 굴지 말았어야 했어."

 NIK.191.t:0 "Intensifying the Crackdowns"
 NIK.191.d:0 "One could sense the tension in the air as General Secretary Ponomaryov appeared to deliver a speech to the army barracks near Syktyvkar, as he had gathered some of the most prominent officers and paramilitary commanders. Of course, not one of them was loyal to the Center or the Right.\n\nThe speech, ignoring the socialist rhetoric and vague promises for progress and reform made, focused on one thing: all loyal units, regular and irregular, would be united under one command, and create the Red Army of the Komi Republic. Closely modelled after all such formations in the history of communist nations, its purpose would be to defend the Republic from any threats that appear, internal or external. At the end of his speech, Ponomaryov received thundering applause, and was cheered by all his allies.\n\nHowever, despite the idealistic remarks made by the General Secretary, the Red Army's goal right now is one, and it is simple: restore order to this chaotic state and ensure the proper establishment of the new regime. The question now is who to focus on eliminating first from the two major movements operating in Komi: the democratic Center, or the Passionariyy right?"
 NIK.191.a:0 "Target the right!"
 NIK.191.b:0 "Target the center!"

 NIK.192.t:0 "The Hunt for Serov"
 NIK.192.d:0 "Ever since he was first involved in politics, Ivan Serov has proven to be one of the most insane ideologues in the Komi Republic. Despite originally claiming to support Suslov, his ideas of "Ordosocialism" have convinced us that he is nothing more than a Nazi in disguise, and him becoming Gumilyov' hawk has only confitmed that. Now that we are in power, we must do everything we can to hunt him down and bring an end to his movement.\n\nThankfully, during the battles for the control of Syktyvkar, we have managed to capture many of his men who fought us as part of the small militia force they comprise. Of course, most will be fiercely loyal to Serov, but we can still try to extract key information from them, namely where their leader is hiding. Through promises of gifts and reduced sentences, our police will eventually break someone, and gain what hints it needs to begin the hunt to take down Serov.\n\nOf course, the information we will be provided by his men may not be entirely reliable, and so some alternatives have been suggested. We have several other possible sources, that although less reliable, could be honest and lead us to the traitor's hideout. Who do we trust?"
 NIK.192.a:0 "Ask the deserters."
 NIK.192.b:0 "Go it alone."

 NIK.193.t:0 "Lies and Deception"
 NIK.193.d:0 ""Lies, lies, and only lies!" That was all the chief of police of the entire Republic had to say regarding Serov's men. Going into this, we expected to get at least some valuable information regarding the group's leader, yet what happened is the exact opposite.\n\nEvery clue we received from the captured Ordosocialist troops has been blatantly false. Not a single one has given us any actual help in determining Serov's whereabouts, each one feeding us with false and contradictory locations and statements that our police has worked hard to debunk, one by one. And now, it seems we have made zero progress in taking down the pseudo-Nazis. The leading members of the party have even started debating whether it is even worth to pursue this fringe group, as what power could it really exert? Now, we have been asked to make the final decision on whether we want to continue using our unclear sources, or end this investigation entirely."
 NIK.193.a:0 "This is a waste of time."
 NIK.193.b:0 "We can take another lead."

 NIK.194.t:0 "Setting the Trap"
 NIK.194.d:0 "The chief of police burst into Ponomaryov's office, holding a stack of paper and dropping it on the table in front of him. In the chief's face, excitement and joy could be seen, as if he had figured out something. Quickly, he began to explain his master plan for capturing Serov.\n\n"Comrade, I have found the solution to all our problems. Instead of hunting down Serov, hoping we eventually catch this mysterious man, we must lure him in. He will always find a way to escape if we merely chase him, but if we get him in the perfect position, we could strike and have the upper hand." The chief paused for a second, clearly to see what Ponomaryov's reaction would be. Then, he continued.\n\n"I have planned it all out. The story to lure Serov in will be a meeting of Ordosocialists, to discuss their survival and their operations against our government. However, it will all be a cover. The meeting will be held in this warehouse to the south of Syktyvkar", he said pointing at a map. "In the building, a special team of agents will be hiding, and once Serov meets his alleged allies, we will strike and take him down easily. So what do you think, Comrade General Secretary?"\n\nPonomaryov gave his reply. "If my comrades in the Party approve it as well, then it has the green light.""
 NIK.194.a:0 "Time for action."

 NIK.195.t:0 "Serov Reveals Himself!"
 NIK.195.d:0 "Serov quietly approached the door of the warehouse, careful not to make noise. He knocked on the door five times, as he had been told to do by his allies organizing the meeting, and the door opened. In front of him was not a face he recognized, but he imagined it was one of the men in his paramilitaries or the lesser known ideologues in his faction.\n\nThe man quickly gave an explanation as to who he was, and what the meeting was for. Serov walked in, and saw the table, around which about two dozen people were walking and discussing. He greeted everyone, and told them to sit down for the meeting.\n\nIn a dark corner, someone talked on a radio. "Target has entered the building. Over." The squad prepared to make their move, and kill Serov once and for all."
 NIK.195.a:0 "Kill him."

 NIK.196.t:0 "The Counter-Strike"
 NIK.196.d:0 "Serov cautiously approached the warehouse, and to his ignorance, several agents loyal to the socialist republic were closely watching him. Every step he took seemed to be calculated in his mind, and nothing was random. When he reached the door to the building, he knocked on it five times, just as his followers had informed him earlier. He entered, but was greeted not by faces of his allies and soldiers, but by gunfire. As he ducked for cover, Serov yelled something that no one could hear amidst the loud sounds of the weapons firing. But soon, seemingly out of nowhere, over a dozen of his men appeared, and went on the counter-offensive.\n\nQuickly, Serov's men began to encircle the building. Some of those pretending to be his allies tried to flee before being captured and suffering the payback for betraying him. Many stayed, protected by the government squad, but even though the trap was specifically designed to succeed, the tide turned in Serov's favor. By the time the sun had set, the gunfire had ended, and no loyal Suslovite remained in the building. Some had even been taken as prisoners, and no one could imagine what the Ordosocialists would do to squeeze information out of them. The trap, originally thought an ingenious plan, had ended in complete humiliation for the government."
 NIK.196.a:0 "We will have to try something else."

 NIK.197.t:0 "The Traitor Lies Dead!"
 NIK.197.d:0 "Within seconds, the squad ran out of the basement they were in, and stormed the meeting. Everyone ducked for cover, as bullets grazed past them and wreaked havoc. One man, Serov himself, once thought a mastermind by some, sat there in confusion. He had fallen for one of their simplest tricks.\n\nThe squad spread across the warehouse, and two of the men blocked each entrance and exit. Serov, having no other choice, ran behind a large wooden box and hid from the shooters. He stayed calm for one second, but immediately the sound of gunshots tearing through the wood made him panic. One of the bullets barely missed him, instead flying into the wall behind him. There were now few things for him left to do. He thought of ways to escape,but it seemed there weren't any.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted when a bullet went through his back, fatally injuring him. He dropped down, and his body was soon found by the police squad. Finally, Serov was dead, and with him, so was his absurd Ordosocialist movement."
 NIK.197.a:0 "The traitor is finally dead."

 NIK.198.t:0 "The Perfect Source"
 NIK.198.d:0 "It appears that we have found the best lead we have on Ivan Serov, and that is his men. The prisoners of war captured with our clashes with the Ordosocialists have proven to be an excellent source of information. We obviously expected them to be knowledgeable on Serov and his remaining men, but were surprised by how easily they gave up information. Perhaps they were not as loyal as we originally thought.\n\nWe have already received a detail on Serov's residence that is more or less accurate. He lives near the suburbs of the capital, relatively isolated yet close to the action. Additionally, we have been informed of the location and short-term plans and goals of what Ordosocialist troops and paramilitaries remain active. With such valuable intel, we could possibly make our hit and end this absurd ideology."
 NIK.198.a:0 "Thank goodness for this information."

 NIK.199.t:0 "Residential Matters"
 NIK.199.d:0 "The sky was completely dark when the men entered the house. The door was easy to break through, and there was little to stop them from breaking in. However, all eight men of the squad knew this could well be one of the most dangerous missions they would ever participate in. They entered the only floor in the building and quickly spread around it.\n\nEach man took a different position, making sure to secure it. The threat awaiting them could be anything, from an actual armed person to a trap, and so everyone was careful. The first course of action was to ensure that there was no armed personnel in the building, and that was quite easy. All hiding spots were checked, and the house was declared clear.\n\nThen, the next step was to search everywhere it was possible, and find any and all evidence. With such a mysterious man, finding hints to lead him would not be an easy process. No matter what they thought, though, they did not have all the time in the world to search."
 NIK.199.a:0 "Search for evidence."

 NIK.200.t:0 "The Plan of Attack"
 NIK.200.d:0 "The Democratic Coalition's leaders have arranged a very important meeting, or at least, what was supposed to be a very important meeting. The reason for the meeting was the... unstable situation in the Republic. Extremists, radicals, and political violence ran rampant. While the death toll was relatively low from all of this infighting, the Democratic Coalition fear things may escalate, leading to coups and the possible collapse of the Republic.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears nobody can decide upon a plan of attack in regards to these fears. A number of representatives believe that the coalition should focus on the left and their dangerous revolutionary rhetoric. Others disagreed, citing the increasing violence from the right as the largest concern. A third camp within the coalition believes that all of this is unnecessary, and that we should simply focus on campaigning and winning the next election.\n\nThe debate eventually completely derailed into ad hominems and shouting matches, and it was clear to the leaders of the coalition that no progress was being made. By the end of the meeting, everyone was equally unhappy, as it was decided that the coalition will simply agree to disagree. The meeting was adjourned, the ad hominems ceased, and the politicians reluctantly returned to their homes."
 NIK.200.a:0 "The Left is the most immediate threat."

The stump of an arm - surely the amputation must have been as recent as it was violent - is tied off and secured with a little Party badge. One of Vosnesensky's men, perhaps?\n\nOfficer Timorovich nods mechanically to his Deputy. "Please note: case type 24-D, class B physical trauma. Prepare for physical examination back at the morgue. No further instructions." He ambles off for a smoke, and Deputy Sadckov begins to wrap the body in medical gauze.\n\nHow long have they done this, the two of them? A dance back and forth and back again across the Republic, picking up the shredded remains of life after life to dispose of in as tasteful a fashion as possible. The Political Crimes Division is nothing more than a sick joke, and the Officers of its hopeless war are jesters in the courts of the powerful. Crimes unseen. Crimes unseeable. Crimes that are discovered and hastily covered up, as with some idiot child that might spew up some inconvenient familial truth at the dinner table.\n\nSadckov's hands tremble as he covers the eyes. He is tired, so very, very tired. And yet the charade goes on.\n\nNot far from him, Timorovich wonders why there has only been one reported murder case this week. It is a precipitous drop from previous months. He rubs his stubble, and then it hits him, like a lead-iron socket in the belly."

But that was merely a mild annoyance in front of the recent events that had put his life and his ideology in danger: Suslov's puppets had taken power in a coup d'etat, and he knew they were already hunting him down. Serov walked out of his bedroom, and headed to the kitchen to eat or drink something.\n\nAs he sat in the kitchen, a sound could be heard. The door made a screeching sound as it opened, and whether it was his paranoia or not, that was a possible threat. He quickly ran down his home's hallway, and headed back to his bedroom, as loud footsteps and voices could be heard from behind. As he entered the room, he turned to lock the door, but realized that it was too late now. He opened the window to escape, and felt the wind blowing on his face for a mere second, before a gunshot was heard. Someone had shot him from behind, undoubtedly the dirty communists. Serov laid there, until his soul left his body.\n\nThe next day, a report would reach the office of General Secretary Ponomaryov, stating that, surprisingly enough, Serov had been caught in his house and killed by the appointed hit squad. Ponomaryov breathed a sigh of relief."
 NIK.202.a:0 "Thankfully, Serov is no more."

 NIK.203.t:0 "Nothing But Air"
 NIK.203.d:0 "The search in the alleged house of Ivan Serov continued all night, but as dawn came, it seemed as if no progress had been made. While his home did not appear to be a "clean" building, where any and all possible evidence was purposefully gone, there was still nothing of value for the police squad in charge of the investigation. A few notes seemed promising, but turned out to be nothing than vague ideas for yet another of his Ordosocialist manifestos and books. The bedroom and living room did not look as if someone had hastily left the house, but were tidy and in order. It was almost impossible to distinguish if this had been done on purpose, or if this was something normal.\n\nThe officers in charge of the mission were at a crossroads. What they had believed to be a treasure for information and leads on the Serov case had turned out to be completely useless. As such, many had suggested leaving the building and trying to follow one of the different clues the government had. But some still felt as if something was off, and with some more searching, the building could be useful after all."
 NIK.203.a:0 "We have other things to worry about."
 NIK.203.b:0 "We have other avenues we can use."

 NIK.204.t:0 "A Lead!"
 NIK.204.d:0 "The chief of police proudly looked at the note, carefully enclosed in a plastic bag as evidence. Its content was so simple, yet so helpful to his department: "Meet behind central Pazhga café, Thursday, 3:40 AM".\n\nIt had been found in a kitchen cupboard, likely hidden at first by everything else there. But one of his men had been thorough enough so as to search there, and there it was found. The chief knew two things: firstly, that man would be getting a promotion soon. Secondly, this was so big, he could very well be presenting his findings in front of the leaders of the party in the same day. Even he himself truly hoped that, after this entire hustle, Serov could finally be caught and face the consequences of his crimes."
 NIK.204.a:0 "Let's head to the meeting."

 NIK.205.t:0 "Ambushing the Ordosocialists"
 NIK.205.d:0 "Everything was in place for the perfect ambush. The days of hard work to track down one of the biggest political opponents in the socialist republic of Komi still at large had finally paid off. The note found in Serov's house had been enough for the government to follow on this lead, and prepare an attack on Serov at the scheduled meeting. After all, what did they have to lose from this?\n\nThe hit squad was composed of fifteen members, all coming from the army and experienced in battles, albeit usually ones between paramilitary units in the streets of Komi. Amidst the darkness of the night, they arrived in the small town of Pazhga in a dark black truck, going unnoticed by the local population there. In the dark road behind the city's largest café, which would certainly be empty at the time the meeting would be held, they prepared their positions. They hid behind walls and windows, or remained somewhere further away, ready to be called in by radio the instant the traitor made his appearance.\n\nAs the hour of the meeting came closer, the chief of squad, who had been obviously assigned responsible for organizing the ambush, had to make up his mind on what the optimal attack would be. He knew quite well that this could even be a trap for the Komi Red Army to derail their efforts. Thus, he had to inform the squad how hard to attack."
 NIK.205.a:0 "Ambush him with everything we have!"
 NIK.205.b:0 "This could very well be a trap..."

 NIK.206.t:0 "The Traitor Lies Dead!"
 NIK.206.d:0 "For once, good news have come out of the Serov investigation. And the news couldn't be better, as that investigation is officially closed.\n\nAs it turned out, the meeting in Pazhga was not a delicate trap, but an honest action by Serov, who did not know we were planning to make our strike there. When he arrived at the specified time, the squad hidden in the road was easily be able to hit. Serov was caught wih his guard down, only having very few men with him, and so we managed to kill them all, including the traitor, and leave the area with very limited casualties.\n\nWith Serov dead, the figurehead of the Ordosocialist movement is gone forever, and no one is likely to replace him. His followers turn to other groups or flee the country, and his paramilitaries scatter in the countryside, only to be hunted down by the Komi Red Army. The Serov case has been deemed an absolute success."
 NIK.206.a:0 "We no longer have to worry now."

 NIK.207.t:0 "The Ambush Fails!"
 NIK.207.d:0 "The latest developments in the Serov case are not beneficial for the government in control of the nation. It appears that Serov was prepared to repel our ambush, and go on the counter-offensive.\n\nOur men initially seemed to be performing well, according to the reports of the surviving troops, but the traitor soon brought in his reinforcements. At around the same number as our own squad, they quickly dealt with the mild annoyance presented, and held back the enemy, while Serov managed to flee the area and move to an unknown location. While the Ordosocialist have still not been dealt with after this fiasco, at least the casualties of the "battle" were few for our own side."
 NIK.207.a:0 "That's something."

 NIK.208.t:0 "The Ambush Fails!"
 NIK.208.d:0 "The ambush planned against Serov in Pazhga could not have gone worse. In all likelihood, the Ordosocialist leader had left the note on purpose, and as such was completely aware of what was coming for him. When our troops came out of their hiding spots, and tried to kill him, he fought back.\n\nFrom other dark corners and streets, Serov's paramilitaries emerged to protect him. Unprepared for such a coordinated defense by their enemy, that was supposed to be coming alone or with a small guard, our own squad was not able to cope with the problem. They fought bravely to maintain their positions and safely withdraw as Serov escaped once again. What's worse, perhaps, is the consequences of this skirmish. The reports claim that a rocket grenade launcher was used by the enemy forces against the squad, causing a massive explosion in the road. Unfortunately, our entire squad died from the blast, and so did 17 innocent civilians that were in the nearby building, which collapsed from the blast as well. Few know of what actually happened in Pazhga that night, as we have covered up the story, but Serov still remains free, roaming the country."
 NIK.208.a:0 "This has been a complete failure."

 NIK.209.t:0 "An Empty Room"
 NIK.209.d:0 "Nikolai sat on a chair, one of the few things the room still had, to contemplate what was happening. For hours now, the house had been turned upside down. Every object had been examined and looked under, and every possible clue that could lead the police to something closely investigated. But, no matter how many men had worked hard throughout the day, absolutely zero progress had been made. Not a single clue had been found.\n\nIvan Serov was a mystery. Perhaps it was his time in the secret police, but he certainly knew how to hide, and he did it well. What worried Nikolai, though, was the reaction of his superiors. What would they think when they learned that he and his co-workers had found a dead end in one of the most important investigations in the history of the socialist regime, as short as it was?"
 NIK.209.a:0 "There is no way to continue."

 NIK.210.t:0 "The Socialist Alternative"
 NIK.210.d:0 ""Greetings, proud citizens of the Komi Republic! My name is Andrei Zhdanov, and you may know me as one of the leading figures of the Left political alliance. Much speculation on the future of this country has occurred, especially following the dissolution of the former regime. However, I have decided to broadcast this message to national radio, to tell you that a bright future is ahead for us."\n\n"Many of you have constructed an image of what a Republic ruled by Suslov's Socialists would be, but these premature conjectures are much different from what awaits it. I, as the General Secretary, will from now on be the leader of this country, dictating its policies and hearing the voices of the people, and from this position, I must inform you that the Suslovite plans will not be fulfilled. What the new government has to offer is the Socialist Alternative. Not a single person will have to worry about falling into poverty, or being chased down by the secret police for their political beliefs. The goal we have set to accomplish is that of a free socialist state, built on the principles of liberty and solidarity."\n\n"The Alternative will be not be built on exclusion of those who do not agree, but inclusion of all who can benefit. It is an undeniable truth that the writings of the first and the greatest proponents of socialism had the best intentions when creating and spreading their ideas. No matter how much leaders twisted them in the past, we are here to rebuild this Republic, for the good of its people."\n\n"It is for that reason that I ask you to respect the state that only cares for your own good and prosperity. Do not bring about the chaos and anarchy that my predecessors could not prevent, but embrace this new opportunity. Together, we can forge a new future for Komi."
 NIK.210.a:0 "Keep it simple - keep it sweet."
 NIK.210.b:0 "The world is not enough!"

 NIK.211.t:0 "The Red Meeting"
 NIK.211.d:0 "It seemed as if Zhdanov had decided not to end any last chance he had of working with the Center. Of course, what was once the leading coalition of the Komi Republic had been scattered by his seizure of power, and so had the Voznesentsi: some had fled Syktyvkar, either to leave the country and push their agenda from abroad, or to continue resisting from the countryside of Komi. However, some members of the former President's faction had still not left the capital, perhaps because they were willing to cooperate. And Zhdanov would capitalize on that opportunity.\n\nThe Center's left wing would be approached with an intriguing chance to remain in power, and that was to peacefully collaborate. Seeing as the new leader of the county had already made an extensive effort to support Voznesensky and his people to get into power, it wasn't that hard to believed that he would use the social democrats to consolidate his rule, which was by no means perfectly stable - even though this was a common occurrence for the governments of Komi.\n\nWhat Zhdanov and his allies understood, though, was that there was perhaps an even better way to solidify their control over the violent political stage, and that was by backstabbing. Having gained the trust of the Voznesentsi, it would be more than simple to make the planned meeting, in which talks with them over a national unity government would be held, a trap. They would be in a perfect position to be arrested, and so the social democratic faction of the Center would disappear in the blink of an eye. In the end, whether betrayal was the best choice was up to Zhdanov."
 NIK.211.a:0 "I've assembled you here so that the Republic may be saved..."
 NIK.211.b:0 "Guards? Take them away."
 
 NIK.212.t:0 "Our Wayward Children Returned"
 NIK.212.d:0 "Today is a day of pride for our socialist republic of the people. As was the plan by the Zhdanov government, we held the meeting with the followers of Nikolai Voznesensky, the aim being to integrate their group into our greater base of support. The plan has paid off, as after talks and negotiations with the social democrats, they have agreed.\n\nThe meeting was held in the National Assembly building, and had to last several days as some details were sorted out regarding the nature of the "unity government". In reality, as the faction in control of this nation, we were able to exert our influence and manage to pressure the Voznesentsi into accepting a deal that favors us. For all intents and purposes, we and the social democrats are one.\n\nAs for the fate of their leader himself, Voznesensky, he has fled the Republic. Stating it is no longer democratic but under a tyranny, he is currently at an unknown location, and perhaps he is plotting his return."
 NIK.212.a:0 "He won't be relevant in the near future."

 NIK.213.t:0 "A Black Day"
 NIK.213.d:0 "Both sides of the meeting, the Zhdanovites and the Voznesentsi, could feel the tension in the room. The building they were in, what used to be the National Assembly of the Republic until it was forcefully dissolved, seemed massive in comparison with the few delegates that had arrived from the two factions to discuss.\n\nIn theory, this was a National Assembly meeting to "hold talks on the formation of a national unity government in face of the crisis the Republic was facing". In practice, it was nothing more than a meeting between a few representatives, as everyone else not part of the non-Suslov Socialists or the Social Democrats was obviously absent. Soon, though, even this meeting which seemed to show potential would devolve into chaos. Government troops stormed the building, trying to arrest all the supporters of Voznesensky. They replied in kind, using both firearms they carried with them and bringing in support from a nearby paramilitary unit.\n\nThe battle was fierce, but in the end, the small number of government troops seemed unable to cope with the unexpected arrival of reinforcements. Under cover from gunfire, the social democrats fled the building, racing to get out of the city before being caught. And it seems they have succeeded, as they disappeared, before the army reported that this group of a few dozen politicians had actually gotten across the border with the Vologda Neutral Zone, entering the neighboring warlord state.\n\nOf course, being neutral and with some democratic aspirations, Vologda has refused to hand over the "political refugees". We have given up on trying to get them under our custody again, as it now appears out of reach. All in all, this mission seems to have been a failure, and the only thing we can do now is cover up the affair from the public."

 NIK.214.t:0 "A Strike Against Fascism"
 NIK.214.d:0 "Yuri Andropov appeared in the headquarters of the Komi Republic Special Forces, far from the busy streets of Syktyvkar, and hidden in plain sight in the countryside. The building did not draw one's attention, cleverly disguised as a normal government building or offices.\n\nThe close associate of Andrei Zhdanov presented himself to the commander of the Squad, who bowed in respect, and quite clearly understood that this was an important case. After completing the typical proceedings and bureaucracy, Andropov was introduced to the group of thirty men handpicked by the regime to lead Plan Blue - the special operation to take the Eurasianists out of the picture. Then, he began to outline the plan to his subordinates.\n\n"I am here on behalf of General Secretary Zhdanov together with my trusted commanders to assign you a mission crucial to this Republic's future - to strike at Lev Gumilyov. On the behalf of the General Secretary, it is my duty to convey the details of this operation, codenamed Plan Wolf."\n\n"Using confirmed reports and eyewitnesses, we have located the hiding spot for the leader of the reactionaries, who is in Slobodskoy and under protection by a local paramilitary unit. This has allowed us to design a plan that, should it be carefully executed, will allow us to capture Gumilyov and perhaps many of his remaining allies, ending the threat they present. It is of crucial importance to maintain the element of surprise and find the perfect moment to strike when their guard is down. Remember, this is no simple operation - it has been assigned to you because you are considered the most capable force available. Preparations will begin shortly.""

Especially if several of their leaders and politicians were to suddenly be revealed to have fascist sympathies, or were selling paramilitary supplies to the highest bidder behind their backs.\n\nBut was seeding the files worth the effort?

An informant discovered the planted files in the trash, which means the plan has failed.\n\nZhdanov's interference was discovered, but how? Was the information contradictory? Were the files out of character for those incriminated within them? Was there a leak from one of their own? Figuring out why this went wrong could prove crucial for the success of future plans. At least the liberals don't seem to be particularly bothered by it, which means that Zhdanov can investigate this small failure free from any distractions that could get in his way."

Zhdanov smiled to himself as he read the reports, a few rushed documents and an underpaid party official had allowed them to deal a nice blow to the liberals of Komi.

 NIK.238.d:0 "If we're to survive this avalanche of dissent that's flooded our streets, we need a plan. Currently, we control very little, and the dissidents control a great deal. With this in mind, there are two prevailing ideas we can attempt that would see this situation flip. The first is simply to cede the majority of the territory, which we'll never be able to patrol completely, in order to build up defenses and fortifications in crucial government buildings and factories. From there, we can begin sending out combat groups to put down any potential rebellions.\n\nThe second plan is more offensive, the idea is to send out pacification teams to quash rebel activity in the more rebellious neighborhoods BEFORE any dissent can form.\n\nWhatever we choose, we must do so quickly."

The locations of arms caches, incriminating documents, and the positions of paramilitary commanders. In order to learn these details, we must raid the headquarters of the Communist Party and Shafarevich's Passionariyy. Those locations are public knowledge, and informants within these buildings can help us find useful intel.\n\nWhile conducting these raids, we have two options for our strategy. The first strategy is to grab only what information our spies can verify, so that we avoid any contingency plans and false intel the enemy may have planted. This is the less risky option, but it also requires more time, and will result in less information being gathered. The other strategy is to grab as many files as we can, sort out the contents, and act upon whatever useful information we happen to come across. This will result in more information being gathered, but is obviously riskier. If we come across false intel, our forces could end up stumbling into a trap. The question is, which strategy do we employ?"

If we don't act upon this information right away, the enemy will be fully-equipped for a coup. We need to seize these weapons and commanders immediately, anything else is a dangerous waste of time. Luckily, it seems the radicals weren't expecting a raid upon their headquarters, so we should have enough time to strike before they can act."

If we could seize these weapons and commanders, we could cripple the radicals and ensure the safety of our government. We need to act quickly, however, since it will only be a matter of time before the enemy realize we've received this intel. If we wait too long, all of this information will be useless and we'll have simply wasted our time.

 NIK.247.d:0 "Sergei opened yet another drawer of yet another filing cabinet. Sergei hated patrolling the city, what with all of the violent paramilitaries roaming the streets, but this assignment was a truly special kind of hell. It was past midnight, and Sergei had spent the last several hours reading mind-numbing documents with a barely functional flashlight. Occasionally they had to drop everything and hide when a car approached the building, but none of the cars ever stopped in front of the building.\n\nFinancial reports, predictions for upcoming party primaries, complaints about cuts to the catering budget, and meeting transcripts about said catering budget complaints. Polls on how voters reacted to different buzzwords, pages and pages of ideological debates, and disappointing salaries filled up each and every filing cabinet in this God-forsaken building. How could someone fill up so many folders with so much irrelevant nonsense? How was it also so disorganized? Sergei swore there was no rhyme nor reason put into what document went where, and Sergei now understood why people complained so much about rising paper prices in Syktyvkar. This was just an unnecessary amount of documents.\n\nThey had been in the building too long, they had to move on. Sergei stuffed several folders of financial reports, and various other documents that seemed especially useless, and just hoped the radicals happened to have the most amazing encryption code in Russia. Maybe some government bureaucrat can find something of value in this pile of trash."

 NIK.248.t:0 "The Decisive Blow"
 NIK.248.d:0 "The Republican Army forces were mobilizing. The information gained from the radicals would be the decisive blow needed in order to stabilize Komi's democracy. The locations of arms caches and wanted paramilitary commanders would be stormed within just a few hours, hopefully before the enemy could mobilize. The operation would be a multi-pronged attack, with squads being deployed across Syktyvkar and the surrounding countryside. Some locations had to be ignored, due to manpower and resource constraints, but the majority could be struck in a reasonable amount of time. If this operation failed... then Komi's republic would likely not last much longer. It was now or never."

 NIK.249.t:0 "Counter-Struck!"
 NIK.249.d:0 "The Republican Army forces spread out across Komi, searching for the wanted commanders and the arms caches the radicals had been stockpiling. These forces were expecting to surprise the enemy, and were not expecting much resistance at the various arms caches they had located. If the intel was correct, then it should have been a decisive blow against the radicals, and a great victory for the Republic. Such a victory could have secured the government's position and ensured democracy's survival.\n\nExcept the intel was wrong.\n\nThe radicals had been expecting the Republican forces to conduct a raid on their files, and had planted false intel. Those locations that were correct and not simply decoys had been fortified and staffed with paramilitaries. When the Republican forces reached these locations, the paramilitaries opened fire upon them.\n\nHeavy losses were sustained, and the Republican forces were sent into disarray. Meanwhile, the cells not present in the false intel or that were simply ignored mobilized. Now radical cells were rising up across Komi.\n\nThe Republic has failed."

If the intel was correct, a heavy blow should be dealt to the radicals, and the government's position would be made more secure.\n\nThe operation was a great success. Using the invaluable intel gathered from the radicals, the Republican forces were able to strike at the perfect moment, catching the radicals off-guard. The radicals' paramilitaries were in the midst of mobilizing as Republican forces opened fire, preventing them from properly arming or establishing a credible force. We've also arrested or killed some of the more experienced paramilitary commanders, crippling their forces' ability to organize. It seems the radicals had been expecting an attack, but our forces must have prepared faster than they had predicted, considering how unprepared the enemy was. Even if we didn't truly possess the element of surprise, we still dealt a huge blow to the radicals' ability to strike against the government. The radicals should be unable to carry out an effective coup. We can breathe a little easier now that our democracy has been secured for now."
 NIK.250.a:0 "Democracy stands strong!"

 NIK.251.t:0 "Their Forces Diverted!"
 NIK.251.d:0 "While we have seen great success with our raids, and the enemy forces seem to have been devastated. However, we have surely not secured every arms cache in Komi, and given time the radicals will surely be able to muster enough forces to carry out a coup. At the very least, our raids mean they can't rise up immediately, and we have likely significantly delayed their plans.\n\nThe time we've bought with these raids is precious. We must use them to further secure our position, further prepare ourselves for possible coup attempts, and further consolidate our rule by other means. While these raids are successful, raids alone can't save our republic. The radicals will also learn from this raid, and will likely better secure their intel and weapon stockpiles. They have been wounded, but their wounds are certainly not fatal. We need to invest in propaganda, we need to introduce reforms, and we need to win over the Komi's citizens. If we can get the civilians to feel safe and support us, the radicals will lack enough support to strike against our government. That is how democracy survives."

 NIK.253.t:0 "Leftist Attacks Reported!"
 NIK.253.d:0 "At first, there were only scattered reports. Right-wing paramilitary leaders attacked in their homes. Businesses broken into in the dead of night, their inventories seized in "proletarian expropriations". Mass spontaneous rallies against the police, with officers temporarily pushed out of entire neighborhoods. As more and more incidents rock Syktyvkar, the communist threat is becoming increasingly clear. There has been an undeniable upward trend in leftist violence in recent days; we have a crisis on our hands.\n\nThe communists have always been a major element in Syktyvkar's street politics, but the political turmoil of the past few weeks has given them an opportunity to drastically expand their operations. In the face of democratic failures, their support has grown and radicalized. A sizable amount of the leftist fringe has been violent in the past, but the audacity of these new attacks on Komi's elite and government is unprecedented. As they might say, we are rapidly approaching a "revolutionary situation".\n\nWhile their challenges to our authority are disturbing, the communists have not made overt threats to the Presidium as of yet. Vigilance is necessary, but we must be careful not to overstep our bounds, lest we give the left an excuse to escalate tensions to the breaking point."
 NIK.253.a:0 "Keep an eye on the reds..."

 NIK.254.t:0 "Leftists Attack Police Station!"
 NIK.254.d:0 "Residents of central Syktykvar were rudely awakened last night by the sounds of yelling and breaking glass, as members of a left-wing paramilitary waged an all-out attack on a local police station. According to witness reports, the incident occurred shortly after midnight. Somewhere between fifteen and twenty-five masked youths armed with bricks and batons stormed the station, breaking windows and assaulting the outnumbered officers. Two officers were hospitalized, but the attackers ignored non-police personnel. Owing to the time, the station was significantly understaffed; investigators believe the operation was meticulously planned to maximize chances of success.\n\nThe instigators successfully fled the scene, but two were recognized by neighbors and subsequently brought into custody. The police have identified them as Anatoly S. and Bogdan P., members of the Workers' Street Battalions, a local ultra-left paramilitary loosely connected to the Communist Party. Both have refused to assist officers with the investigation. Judging by the coordinated nature of the operation and its members' discipline, the possibility exists that this attack was ordered by Party higher-ups as a show of force, rather than being an impulsive move by radical "lone wolves"."

 NIK.255.t:0 "Sabotage on the Roads!"
 NIK.255.d:0 "Driving in Syktyvkar, with its poorly kept roads and tendency towards street violence, has never been easy. Cars tend to be reserved for businessmen and politicians, people who value privacy, speed, and security in their travels and have the money or connections to get the best possible transport. This makes road travel prestigious -as well as a target for those who seek to destabilize the Republic.\n\nThree days ago, a simultaneous detonation of several explosive devices on roads and bridges in central Syktyvkar paralyzed the city for several hours, as first responders were unable to reach the scene. Despite the devastation caused by these bombings, the perpetrators appear to have attempted to minimize casualties; the explosions occurred in the middle of the night, and the primary targets were the roads surrounding the Presidium building and several prominent local businesses. However, they still claimed two lives, and five other people have been hospitalized. The bombers are currently unidentified and remain at large, but the targeting of local elites suggests that they belonged to radical leftist movements.\n\nThis is a sobering day for the Republic. The bombings took Syktyvkar's already beleagured police force completely by surprise. Justice becomes less likely with each passing hour, while the militant Communists become ever more organized."
 NIK.255.a:0 "The road to chaos..."

 NIK.256.t:0 "Paramilitaries Ambushed!"
 NIK.256.d:0 "Komi's myriad feuding political organizations have often come to blows. Bloody noses and broken bones are a common sight after weekend street rights between the competing paramilitaries of the far left and far right. These clashes are rarely lethal, which makes the recent murder of several paramilitary commanders all the more shocking.\n\nUsing military-grade weaponry, a leftist radical has assassinated three lieutenants of a street fighting group associated with our government's forces. The boldness of this assault is unprecedented; the victims were ambushed outside of a local restaurant, where they had been having lunch, scarcely past noon. The attacker threw a grenade at the establishment before gunning the men down with a machine pistol. He was himself killed in a shootout with their bodyguards shortly afterwards. Officers were able to find his identity, that of one Vasily K., and determine his political affiliations through his possessions, which included The Communist Manifesto, but he has no clear connections to the Communist Party or local leftist groups. This suggests either that he was a lone wolf or that he was very good at covering his tracks.\n\nReports are already coming in of escalating tensions between active militias, as both sides prepare for the possibility of revenge killings and a spiral of violence. The situation on the streets is becoming ever tenser, and law enforcement seems powerless to stop the killings."

 NIK.257.t:0 "Church Burnt to the Ground!"
 NIK.257.d:0 "Any person with even a grain of political literacy is aware that the far left has always had a tense relationship with organized religion. Komi's communists have been vocal in their displeasure at Christianity, especially as churches became bolder in their activity with the withdrawal of the WRRF from Syktyvkar. In past days, this mostly took the form of angry rallies outside religious institutions, but normality seems to have ascended to a higher plane since the beginning of our political turmoil.\n\nA church associated with Syktyvkar's conservative monarchists has recently been burned to the ground in what appears to be the most flagrant arson attack in several years. Fortunately, it was empty, the blaze having struck roughly two hours after the end of Sunday services. Officers were initially unable to find a perpetrator or motive, until the presumed arsonist mailed a letter to the police station filled with anti-religious invective and sections from The Communist Manifesto. Rumors about the arsonist and their potential future targets have spread like wildfire throughout Syktyvkar's religious community, and several prominent churches have employed police or militia guards.\n\nEven in Komi's perpetually agitated political climates, churches have largely remained safe from direct assault. The fact that previously untouchable targets have fallen under attack is a testament to the undeniable decline of political order and state power. The only thing that can be done now is pray that the situation won't degrade to an even greater degree."
 NIK.257.a:0 "Is nothing sacred anymore?"

 NIK.258.t:0 "Communist Attack on the Government!"
 NIK.258.d:0 "Despite the breakdown in order on the streets of Syktyvkar, many politicians believed government buildings would be spared. The Presidium would simply be too risky of a target, and, no matter how swamped with cases, the police force would be tireless in pursuing any would-be assailant. It is clear now that they were tragically mistaken.\n\nThe clock was scarcely past ten last morning when the sound of mortar shells hitting the Presidium building badly rattled Syktyvkar's residents. Communist militiamen posted on a nearby building had timed the attack precisely to when as many moderate and conservative politicians as possible were inside the building. Thankfully, there were no deaths; security was well prepared and the evacuation went smoothly. The vast majority of the Communist Party was curiously absent at the time, although its leadership has completely denied knowledge of the events and pledged to fully cooperate with the police investigation. Many in the police are skeptical, but the crisis-level criminal situation has made them completely unable to coordinate a serious inquiry. Communist presence in many of Komi's neighborhoods has reached the point where they can credibly challenge the police, and few are eager to see what would happen if they clashed openly.\n\nThis attack has completely shattered the illusion that Komi's politicians are insulated from the upswing in political violence. The only question now is whether the politics of the street will inevitably overpower the politics of the state, or if Komi's government still has a leg to stand upon."
 NIK.258.a:0 "Code Red!"

 NIK.259.t:0 "Fascist Attack on the Government!"
 NIK.259.d:0 "As if the attacks from the left were bad enough, the government is now facing serious challenges from the other direction. Right-wing violence has often taken the backseat to communist militancy in the eyes of Komi's state and police forces, especially with the preponderance of left-wing terrorist attacks in the past several weeks. As they are finding out all too late, Komi's establishment have seriously underestimated the threat the right poses to the government.\n\nRadical right-wing Passionarists shelled the Presidium and its immediate surroundings with mortar rounds during a press conference, killing several journalists. By sheer chance, the blasts failed to kill any politicians, although two Communist Party legislators received light injuries. Right wing parties were not present at the events. Lev Gumilyov informed reporters that the Passionarists were having a meeting at the time, although he failed to elaborate on the reason for convening or the topics covered. Several Passionarist politicians, declining to provide evidence, allege that the attack was a false flag by police or radical leftists and completely deny complicity.\n\nWhile the journalists' families are left to mourn their dead, the government must confront the fact that it is under full assault from not one but two extremist factions. Syktyvkar's experts have little faith that the government, already struggling to contain the communists, can quickly devote adequate resources to this new crisis, but the past few weeks have shown one thing for certain: there is always a way that the situation can get worse."

 NIK.260.d:0 "The breakdown of Komi's political system is now accompanied by the shattering of order on the streets. As paramilitaries rage and the police desperately try to restore stability to the city, less scrupulous citizens have resorted to simply stealing what they need from shops and businesses.\n\nSome of these new brigands are political radicals, forcibly expropriating goods from what they see as either bourgeois thieves or plotters against the nation. Others are desperate members of Syktyvkar's poor, simply trying to survive in the midst of this turmoil. Most are somewhere in between, disaffected citizens who have lost faith in the democratic government to give them the basic necessities of life. The sheer magnitude of these lootings, their spontaneity, and their low priority given the abundance of more severe dangers to the Republic have disincentivized a serious police response, making it unlikely that many of the thousands of perpetrators will face justice in the near future.\n\nWhile not a direct political challenge to the state's security, these lootings symbolize the grave fact that many of Komi's denizens no longer respect law and order. Only time can tell whether the police's absence on the streets is a temporary case or a permanent surrender of authority, but things do not look good for the Republic."

What can only be described as a sick glorification of violence and martyrdom impels fascists and other such groups to charge suicidally at far stronger foes, even when moderation would be a smarter tactic. Sometimes, audacity pays off, as superior forces occupied by seemingly more important matters overlook a hidden threat until too late.\n\nA monarchist offshoot group sent shivers down the spines of Komi's citizens and police force recently when it seized a fortified arsenal in central Syktyvkar and made off with a great quantity of firearms and explosives. Despite being outnumbered significantly by the police, the right-wingers' ferocity and their use of ambush tactics made the attack a massacre. Ten police officers were killed, with at least twice as many wounded, with only a single assailant killed in response.\n\nNow even more heavily armed, Komi's right-wing will likely continue its bloody quasi-insurgency against the state. These days, it seems as though the government is but a sheep surrounded by slavering wolves, with no way to escape or punish these vicious enemies."

As the republic teeters on its foundations, fascist groups have extended their reach throughout the city of Syktyvkar, carving out a safe haven for their brand of violent activism.\n\nIn another worrying showcase of how little the law seems to matter to some of Syktyvkar's less savory residents, far-right groups associated with Sergei Taboritsky's monarchist movement occupied a government owned public housing block, ejecting members of the community and seemingly converting the establishment into a fascist stronghold. Armed paramilitaries stand guard around the clock, leaving the police seemingly powerless to take the building back for the citizenry. One can only guess what is taking place behind those walls, but the streams of rightists moving in and out of them suggests that the center is being used for training, coordination, propaganda operations, or other such activities.\n\nIt is always worrying to see the far-right gain ground, but such aggressive moves suggest that the fascists are preparing for crises yet to come. The state cannot afford to ignore them for even a moment."
 NIK.262.a:0 "Not very neighborly of them, to say the least."

 NIK.263.t:0 "Fascists Seize Arms Stockpile!"
 NIK.263.d:0 "As the weeks go by, Komi's fragile order seems on its deathbed, and the vultures are circling only closer overhead. The far-right and far-left's attacks on democracy have only increased in severity and frequency, and without clear leadership or the ability to preserve order the state is unable to mount an effective response. The extremists smell blood in the water, and they will ruthlessly tear Komi apart to install their agendas.\n\nThe far-right's adventurism has only escalated, as they use the spoils of earlier raids to go after bigger targets. A recent attack on a weapons storage facility led to the Passionarist perpetrators making out like bandits, humiliating the police in the process. The pitched battle killed more fascists than officers, but they still got their prize: a cache of military-grade equipment that could easily be put to use performing more mayhem in the streets.\n\nAs losses continue to roll in for the police, many of Syktyvkar's residents are beginning to wonder whether they can rely on anyone, other than themselves, to protect them."
 NIK.263.a:0 "Do the fascists have any humanity at all?"

 NIK.264.t:0 "Fascist Sabotage Attempt!"
 NIK.264.d:0 "As Komi's populace has had to learn quickly, no one is safe from political violence. The police and the politicians are the greatest targets, but ordinary people can find themselves the victims of terror and madness without any notice. The fascists are particularly culpable in this atmosphere of dread, since they target civilians indiscriminately in their mad attempts to purify the city.\n\nCitizens on their morning commute were very nearly the latest victims of right-wing violence, as unidentified members of the Passionarist movement planted a bomb on a local streetcar. Only luck prevented shrapnel from ripping through over twenty people; the device, an improvised explosive made from spare parts, failed to detonate. The police are hard at work searching for the culprits, but the remote nature of the operation makes finding them unlikely.\n\nTo say the police caught an enormous break would be an understatement. If things had gone only slightly differently, there would be an enormous scandal on the government's hands. The far-right will surely not stop its terror attacks after this defeat, and all the Republic can do is hope that its good fortune does not run out."

 NIK.265.d:0 "Komi's population has never been content to bottle up its discontent in silence. Rallies, strikes, and mass gatherings are a common sight on the streets of Syktyvkar. There are many in the city who feel as though the Republic's leaders have failed them, and in this political moment that number has steadily grown.\n\nProtests that once numbered in the hundreds now number in the thousands. A blistering array of demonstrations, some planned by a community or labor organization and some completely spontaneous, have paralyzed the central city, as citizens demand higher pay, better conditions, police protection, and other vague yet intense demands. Most are relatively peaceful, but some have broken out into full-fledged violence, overwhelming the thinly stretched ranks of the police.\n\nPoliticians, relatively isolated from the chaos consuming the streets, are starting to feel the pressure. Komi's already very serious problem with radicals will likely only worsen, as a greater quantity of people becomes convinced that violence is the only way to alter the system. Among the nervous ranks of the elite, one thought predominates: if this continues, the Republic's very future may be at risk."

 NIK.266.d:0 "What are the law, justice, or government other than products of a mass popular consensus? All it takes to destroy even those institutions that seem immense and all-encompassing is a gradual loss of people's faith in them. Komi's institutions are new and brittle, and in the face of a crisis of legitimacy they are starting to shatter.\n\nThe public attitude towards authority has changed noticeably for the worse, much to the chagrin of Komi's police and elected officials. Neighborhoods have walled themselves off, driving away officers and relying on each other (and sometimes radical paramilitaries) for security. The message is clear: the people no longer trust the government to help them.\n\nIf Komi's government is to survive in its current form, it needs to reaffirm to the populace that it is able to protect them. As the slow collapse of police authority in much of Syktyvkar confirms, the Republic is a long way off from earning back the public's trust."

There is the matter of our recent occupation, which has been neither gentle nor accepted in the eyes of the occupied, and there is also the matter of our perceived political weakness. Needless to say, our checkered history has not brought any confidence to the masses here; the other day one of our members overheard the re-enactment of a recent coup-attempt in the streets, complete with bawdy and inappropriate rhetoric towards our nation's leadership.\n\nWe have also attached photos of recent demonstrations; as you have most likely already heard, the latest series of protests involved effigies of senior government figures. Efforts to trace the ringleaders of these demonstrations have proved futile, but in truth many of the activities performed in these photos are likely to be spontaneous: after all, it does not take a political provocateur to light a petrol-soaked doll on fire. The rampant violence in the wake of these protests on civilian governance institutions, however, are believed to have been pre-organized, and our garrison has been ordered to secure the culprits and make their punishment public...\n\nSummary: Situation in Kotlas slowly worsening - occupation policy main cause.

By this metric the crowd that has gathered around the Communist Party Headquarters of Syktyvkar have become more than a mere threat: they have become an organized danger to the Headquarters' occupants.\n\nYelling the names of Gumilyov and Shafarevich, the mob holds aloft posters declaring their unabashed love for Passionaryy and their equal hatred of the State. Agitators shouting into microphones only amplify the chaos as they fan the flames of a thousand hatreds. Rage at the Government's latest policy maneuvers, the nationalisation of industries, and the abhorrent Marxist filth that has gotten into the public education system coalesces into a single turbid mass of discontent with the status quo. As the sun sets to the west, the crowd only grows in numbers and in fury - Party members attempting to reason with them are forced back and spat upon.\n\nA febrile brew of hatred, waiting for a spark - and with a single gunshot the whole edifice is set alight.\n\nNo one knows who fires the shot, or if the Government, or Passionaryy remnants, or outside agitators, is behind the escalation. In a sense, it is immaterial - the enraged mob reacts precisely the way one would expect an enraged mob to behave. Residents throw themselves against the walls, attempting to crawl up, and several are injured by barbed wire before the crowd succeeds in pushing a barricade aside.\n\nThe doors are locked, and the doors long since barricaded (standard Party policy), but one inventive protestor manages a parting shot. A Zhdanov cocktail is thrown through the windows, and the conflagration consumes a room of documents before it is put out in the morning."
 NIK.268.a:0 "A dark omen for what lies ahead."

 NIK.269.t:0 "Anti-Government Riots in Syktyvkar!"
 NIK.269.d:0 "The Capital of the Republic of Komi: shiny, stinking. A rotten salmon in the moonlight. Cool air flows through buildings like hands through unkempt dollar-bills, into public spaces dripping neon-white confusion on street signs and protest slogans. Crowds melt and ebb and gather, viscous, ephemeral: the new youth hang on street corners, their tongues echoing all variants of political thought. Tense times. Tense city. Komi fears.\n\nTonight: hooded gazes, coming in packs, like hyenas stalking prey. Everyone sees the storm, the hail-like rain falling in the distance. They come anyway. Wordless is their engine - heart-stirrings from the crushing and cracking city. Komi is a machine, endless vistas of flesh, working like gears. They are spanners. Their time has come.\n\nPolice guards, eyes held like pistols, steady, unyielding, quietly lethal. Barriers, flesh and plywood, holding back the street. Whispers turn to talk, then to yells. Thuds echo - not thunder. Wood on flesh, unmistakeable. Points, screams, then all at once, as an orchestra slamming into a new note, a sea breaking on undiscovered tides -\n\nAction.\n\nOne, two, three shots, and the crowd overwhelms the pistoleer. As its sound fades, new ones replace it. Windows shatter like chandeliers, falling from the sky's ceiling. Here and there, trashcans lit aflame, left to roll around. New jesters for a court turned upside down. The Government. The businessmen. The army. The Jews. Suddenly all are enemies, and all must be brought to trial. Syktyvkar is a court, a trial run for the people's justice, and its citizens are vengeful judiciaries.\n\nNothing happens; rather, everything happens unseen. Street-sweepers arrive to clear the flaming wreckage. Dirt-smeared signs are cleared by noon. Everyone, of course, says nothing."
 NIK.269.a:0 "This will not be the last. We know this."

 NIK.270.t:0 "General Strike Declared!"
 NIK.270.d:0 "Valentina fiddled with his pens, as he usually did at times of strife like these. There were many, gathered from all the four corners of Russia by collectors and tradesmen, and their nibs ranged from the thick and stylistic to the thinnest of thin. It was a forgotten art, and he was a middling collector. A quiet pride for the old factory worker - something to do with his free time, something the Government couldn't take away.\n\nToday, however, he had different goals in mind. He chose one of his largest nibs, almost the size of a vegetable stalk, and grabbed a red inkwell from his study. There was work to be done, heralded by the ring of the doorbell. He raised his hands out the window, clapping twice - "no surveillance agents nearby" - and closed the windowsill. Comrade Pushkov would not tolerate lateness.\n\nPushkov had brought the little scamp Iosef with him, out of pity or some misguided sense of duty Valentina could not say. Sighing, Valentina ruffled the little boy's hair, told him not to touch anything in the attic, and got to work on the massive canvas laid out in the living room. Touch upon touch the letters rose in brilliant Cyrillic font - WORKERS RISE UP! OPPRESSION MUST END, OR THE STRIKE WILL NOT! - and with them the little flourishes Valentina had practiced: hammers, sickles and stars seemed to take flight upon the carefully woven synthetic paper.\n\nAs the canvas seemed to fill with color and energy, Pushkov nodded. It was time to bring the little artwork into the open. Iosef skipped with excitement as they neared the crowds near the old factory, a furious mass of masked workers and angry signs. Valentina gestured rudely, and Iosef, nodding, took the banner's edge and unfurled it into the air. The banner took flight, joining the hundreds already in the air, and yells of exuberance arose from the heightened crowd. Smiling, Valentina joined in.\n\nThousands more would join the procession, and protests like it across Syktyvkar, as the industry of Komi ground to a halt. The workers' tide rose, a wave of garish red, and the Government stood helpless to stop it."
 NIK.270.a:0 "This is foolishness! Get back to work, all of you!"

 NIK.271.t:0 "Republican Bandits Raid City Outskirts!"
 NIK.271.d:0 "We've been receiving scattered, but consistent reports all morning about a raid upon the outskirts of the city of Syktyvkar by an army of Republican holdouts!\n\nTruthfully, 'army' is being quite generous. We're being attacked by men with makeshift weapons and small arms.\n\nNo one we've interviewed has been able to give us a straight answer on what they're after, but witnesses report that they were focusing more on our defences than upon the populace, additionally, a few were spotted scribbling in notebooks, suggesting that this might be the probing force before a much larger operation."
 NIK.271.a:0 "Fortify everything!"
 
 NIK.272.t:0 "Conflict in the Police!"
 NIK.272.d:0 "Our regime has many opponents, and these opponents have managed to organize the civilian population of Komi into misguided protests. These protests have steadily escalated against our regime, and with the appearance of armed individuals within these crowds, it is clear that our government's survival is at stake. Therefore, our government has decided to send in the police, and forcefully disperse the protestors. It may become a scandal, but the lives of a few dissidents is a price we are willing to pay for stability.\n\nOur police arrived on the scene, armed and ready to disperse the protestors. When it became clear that they would not stand down, they were given the order to open fire. Except, when the protestors called for the police to 'march with us,' that is exactly what some did. A large portion of the police sent to disperse the protestors refused to fire, citing the protestors as 'non threatening.' Clearly these policemen need to be dismissed, as their loyalties are not with their government, as they should be.\n\nThe larger problem is the fact that the protests continue, and only grow in size. As they grow, our government can't help but notice that more and more weapons are appearing amongs the crowds. We need a new plan, since we clearly can't rely on law enforcement."
 NIK.272.a:0 "Who are they supposed to serve?!"

 NIK.273.t:0 "Shots Fired Near Internatsionalnaya Street!"
 NIK.273.d:0 "Despite the fall of their government, the Republican Army has refused to surrender. Now resistance cells dot the countryside, engaging in guerilla campaigns against our government and our forces. They aren't a direct threat to our government, but they are keeping us from securing our hold over Komi, and it is clear that we should have been more thorough during our coup. The most recent news to reach our government only helps to confirm such a perspective.\n\nApparently, one of our Army patrols travelling between cities has been attacked. The culprits were Republican Army holdouts, who had set up an ambush on Internatsionalnaya Street. The encounter was brief, but bloody, and our forces took multiple casualties. They were forced to return to Syktyvkar, and apparently our soldiers failed to eliminate the rebels that attacked them. We need to send a more prepared force to snuff out this holdout, and we will need to discuss the republican problem further."
 NIK.273.a:0 "They may be a nuisance, but they are not a threat."

 NIK.274.t:0 "Republican Bandits Strike Patrol!"
 NIK.274.d:0 "Increased reports have been filtered through local police departments of brutal thuggish attacks by groups of armed men on minority citizens. Rightist bandits, in their filthy radical pleasures, are reported to gang-up on vulnerable jews and other ethnic minorities in back alleys and darkened streets, beating them senseless. Indeed, their presence is known even by passers-by who recognise them as villains.\n\nThey cause a general chaos in our republic, and although these events are limited and victims often survive, they are becoming more frequent and more deadly in nature. In fact, the attacks are telling of the bigotry that has plunged so deep into the hearts of Russia's criminals; a reflection of the vile and cruel state our once great nation has sunk into."
 NIK.274.a:0 "Disaster!"

 NIK.275.t:0 "Reactionary Paramilitary Activity Spikes!"
 NIK.275.d:0 "Marching in the eastern frontiers of our republic, the Red Army's steps crunched in the snow. Their strides were orderly, making their way to the nearest village from an encampment. Our men were tired and bitter from the cold, the only thing keeping them going was the thought of food and warmth as they approached civilization.\n\nSuddenly a piercing ring shot through the valley and our men were fired upon from battlements hidden in the wilderness' icy hills. The zip and crackle of gunfire caught many soldiers off-guard and sliced through their limbs; some of our men were chewed up completely by the opening spray of machine-gun fire. Fortunately, however, our men regrouped and engaged in this defensive skirmish with the invisible enemy, and eventually pushed on the offensive.\n\nBandit gunmen, it seemed, had surprised our brave soldiers in the hopes of stealing arms and munitions to supply their own pathetic caches scattered across the wintry forests of northern Russia. Their dead had been identified as rightist paramilitary forces; insurgents who had taken up arms in a feeble resistance against the communist government. Their 'noble' resistance took the form of these pitiful clashes, only resulting in violence and misery. Once the skirmish was over and blood had spilled red into the winter's snow, the Red Army men counted the lifeless bodies in the snow - now aware of political violence proliferating in our frontiers."
 NIK.275.a:0 "Help!"

 NIK.276.t:0 "Vehicles Sabotaged in Slobodskoy!"
 NIK.276.d:0 "Much to our shock, it seems a fleet of government trucks have been sabotaged today in Slobodskoy! While the trucks seemed fine from a cursory glance, the engines were sabotaged so that they couldn't even start. Due to the internal nature of this, no one realized that the trucks were broken until a soldier tried to start them this morning. After panicking, the soldiers realized that every truck in the fleet was sabotaged.\n\nAs this is where a solid amount of our trucks are located, this deals a heavy blow to our ability to move around troops. While an investigation has started to figure out who did this, it will certainly be difficult to find any evidence, as it seems likely that this sabotage occurred at least a few days ago."
 NIK.276.a:0 "Damn it!"

 NIK.277.t:0 "Aiding the Party?"
 NIK.277.d:0 "Bukharina leaned back in her chair, contemplative. Komi was in chaos. Everyone knew it, from the peasants all the way up to Bukharina herself. Furthermore, it was clear that she needed to stabilize quickly, or else she'd likely be overthrown by some other faction. The Republic itself had a fair amount of resources, and proper application of said resources would probably be enough to stabilize Komi, given time. Time that she may not have.\n\nBukharina paused her musings and drank from her cup of tea. It was sweet, but not sweet enough, leaving a bitter aftertaste in her mouth. Of course, she did not have to stand alone against her enemies. There was always the option of allying herself with major figures in the Party like Suslov or Zhdanov. Their extralegal help would alleviate a lot of the strain from stabilization, and it would allow her to focus more resources on other necessary functions. Of course, there was the obvious consequence that whoever she accepted aid from would gain influence in the party, which could prove dangerous. Was it worth obtaining aid if it'd lead to her being stabbed in the back later on? Would her not leaning on the Party for help lead to her government being overthrown by someone else? Neither option was completely ideal, but hopefully she'd be able to handle the consequences of either one."
 NIK.277.a:0 "We can rely on the Republic's resources."
 NIK.277.b:0 "Let us ask our comrades for help."

 NIK.278.t:0 "A Strategic Alignment"
 NIK.278.d:0 "Like everything in Komi, choosing who to align with was not easy. While Bukharina theoretically had the total support of the Communist Party, the reality was much more complex. The various factions all had their own goals, and while they supported her to an extent, it was obvious that they withheld a certain amount of their resources for their own purposes. This left Bukharina with a tough choice: who?\n\nShe could align with Suslov, gaining support from the orthodox communists. However, such a move would only boost Suslov's already powerful control of the party. On the other hand, she could align with Zhdanov, but that would risk his influence growing greater as well, albeit allowing the two of them to check Suslov's power. Theoretically, she could lean on only her own people in the party for aid, but that would likely signal a huge blow to the party unity. It seemed she'd have to make yet another tough choice."
 NIK.278.a:0 "Suslov is the most powerful, let us align with him."
 NIK.278.b:0 "Aligning with Zhdanov is the best option."
 NIK.278.c:0 "To hell with party unity, go it alone!"

 NIK.279.t:0 "Raiding the Radios"
 NIK.279.d:0 "Dimitri sat down at the table along with his comrades, trying to calm his uneasy breathing. While he supposed it was natural for him to be nervous, seeing as how Bukharina herself assigned them this mission, it wouldn't be good to be openly anxious. Dimitri took a deep breath.\n\n"Alright comrades, Bukharina herself has assigned us to conduct a raid. I'm sure you've all heard that one anti-communist radio station at some point, the one with the hosts who drink a lot?" Dimitri looked around, seeing nods from everyone present. "Good. It's my job to conduct a raid on that radio station and end its blaring of propaganda. Now, seeing as the situation in Komi is not exactly the most stable, we can't afford to quickly muster up troops, as such a diversion could lead to a counter-coup. Of course, if we take a long time slowly pulling troops, the Republican Guard could catch wind of it." Dimitri paused, but was left unable to continue as another officer interjected with his own idea, spiralling into an hour long discussion. At the end of the discussion, Dimitri was left with a choice: devote a fair amount of resources to the raid, or deeply plan it out, allowing for more forces to be mustered?"
 NIK.279.a:0 "A moderate amount of resources is all we need."
 NIK.279.b:0 "If we don't plan this out and muster more resources, we are doomed to fail!"

 NIK.280.t:0 "Successful Media Blackout"
 NIK.280.d:0 ""While we were able to successfully raid the radio station, we sadly were unable to find the radio operator or any traces of where they might have gone. We restaffed the station with our own people, and it now plays classical music." Dimitri said. Bukharina smiled at him.\n\n"It is slightly disappointing that the operator got away, but I'm happy you and your men were able to end their slanderous broadcasts without issue. Is your report finished?" Bukharina asked. Dimitri nodded. "Good. You're free to go. Enjoy the rest of your day."\n\nDimitri left Bukharina's office, happy. Maybe he'd relax tonight and listen to some music on the radio? There was a new station to listen to, after all."
 NIK.280.a:0 "The airwaves fall under our control."

 NIK.281.t:0 "A Complete Silence"
 NIK.281.d:0 ""During our raid of the radio station, we were able to capture someone. The information acquired from him let us launch secondary raids, allowing for the group coordinating the broadcasts to be captured. They are now under our custody." Dimitri said, proud. Bukharina smiled, very pleased.\n\n"Well done, comrade! I am very impressed with your efforts, and am happy to see that I have good, competent people in the army. Give your men my congratulations and thanks for their hard work." Bukharina shook Dimitri's hand. "I hope you can keep up the good work, comrade.""
 NIK.281.a:0 "Nothing feels better than success."
 
 NIK.282.t:0 "The Airwaves, Alive!"
 NIK.282.d:0 ""Our apologies for a delayed broadcast tonight, some of Bukharina's lot thought they'd actually try to shut us down!" The radio broadcaster said, before drinking some alcohol. "Thankfully, the legitimate army, in the Republican Guard, came and helped us out! They even managed to bring a tank and dealt heavy casualties to the communists."\n\n"You'd think the so-called government has better things to do than raid our little quaint radio station, eh?" The other broadcaster said, chuckling. "Maybe they're not as powerful as they seem, if they can't manage to knock us out? In any case, let's get to our program tonight: how Bukharina's government is doomed to fail!""
 NIK.282.a:0 "What a disaster."

 NIK.283.t:0 "Fascists Raid Supply Caches!"
 NIK.283.d:0 "Bukharina stared at the messenger, growing more and more angry. "You mean to tell me that not only have the fascist militias raided supply caches, but they raided the supply caches meant for wounded civilians?"\n\n"Y-yes Comrade." The messenger fidgeted, unsure of what to do as Bukharina scowled at him. She looked at the messenger, taking a deep breath and unclenching her fist.\n\n"Please leave, you can finish later," Bukharina said. The messenger left. Bukharina slammed her hand on her desk, ignoring the pain. She'd known that the fascists were absolute scum, but to steal supplies meant for innocents? Did they have no sense of care for the people at all? Civilian casualties may be acceptable losses for the fascists, but they weren't to Bukharina. She'd have to try to pull supplies from somewhere else ,or counter-raid the fascist caches to make up the loss. It would be hard, but she could do it. After all, she'd come this far, right?"
 NIK.283.a:0 "The people shall be protected!"

 NIK.284.t:0 "Further Escalation?"
 NIK.284.d:0 "It was calm. Fighting had been low-intensity, at best, and major raids had been nonexistent over the past few days. Bukharina was aware that no one was finished, and that such a calm period was merely all sides reconsolidating their forces. She leaned back in her chair, drinking a cup of water. While it would be easy to wait for the other factions to make a move and respond from there, now was the perfect chance to make a move of her own.\n\nBukharina saw herself with two major options. First, she could move to lock down the streets, sweeping them clean of the opposition. Such a move would strengthen the internal security of Komi, and help stabilize the regime. Of course, this move would also move her to a more defensive stance as she consolidated her power in the territory she had.\n\nThe other major move she could make was to go after the leaders of the opposition. By cutting off the head of the snake, the opposition would be left prone, allowing her to solidly beat them. However, if the assassination attempts were to fail, the fighting would escalate dramatically, leading to more bloody and risky battles. There was a third option, where she locked down the streets and went after the leaders, but such a move could easily leave her overextended and prone to a countercoup. Bukharina gently rubbed her temples as she mulled over her options."
 NIK.284.a:0 "Lock down the streets, we need internal security."
 NIK.284.b:0 "Go after the leaders."
 NIK.284.c:0 "We need to do both to secure the regime."

 NIK.285.t:0 "Kosygin Survives!"
 NIK.285.d:0 "It seems that despite our efforts, Alexei Kosygin has survived our attempt to assassinate him! While we were able to begin the process of poisoning him, Kosygin quickly realized something was amiss and was able to seek medical attention, leaving him with no lasting effects. Kosygin has also managed to hide elsewhere, and is currently beyond our reach. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assasination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with the method of assasination, in poison, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism in Komi may become more desperate..."

 NIK.286.d:0 "It was only noon, but Kosygin already felt tired. Attempting to restore democratic rule in Komi was no easy feat, but it only seemed to grow more and more stressful. He gently rubbed his temples in an attempt to stave off his headache, to no avail. Did he have any meetings scheduled today? He tried to think through the pain in his head, the sporadic gunfire interrupting his attempts. Damn it, he couldn't remember. Maybe some water would help?\n\nKosygin greedily drank a cup of water, finding that he was parched. It tasted... off, to say the least, but it had tasted that way for a while. It was of no issue to him. He began walking back to his desk, accidentally bumping into the wall. Shit, how out of it was he? Maybe he should just try to sleep? Kosygin stumbled to his room, finding that his center of balance was off. He fumbled with the doorknob, straining his eyes to focus on it.\n\nKosygin all but fell into bed, only just remembering to take his shoes off before pulling up the covers. Yes. A nice, long nap would be good, he thought, as he closed his eyes. He would never open them again."
 NIK.286.a:0 "A peaceful end."

 NIK.287.d:0 "It seems that despite our efforts, Nikolai Voznesensky has survived our attempt to assassinate him! The soldiers sent to deal with Voznesensky were successful in their attempt to capture him, but he managed to escape when they were en route to the location where he was to be hanged, escaping into the streets. Voznesensky has managed to hide elsewhere, and is currently beyond our reach. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assasination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with Voznesensky's frankly astounding escape story, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown!

 NIK.288.d:0 "Voznesensky awoke to a gun pointed at his face. Fuck. The soldier holding the gun gestured for him to get up. He reluctantly did, seeing that he had no other option. The soldier escorted him outside, to a truck. Voznesensky noted that some of his guards laid on the ground, dead. Damn it. He'd grown too used to the sounds of gunfire, and ignored it at a critical time. The soldier escorted him into the back of the truck, and it began to move.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Voznesensky realized something. There was only one guard. Maybe it wasn't the end yet. The soldiers hadn't tied his hands, confident that they could stop him. He just needed a distraction, and then he could make an escape. Voznesensky waited, knowing that something would come. This was Komi, after all. An thunderous boom suddenly echoed, leaving Voznesensky's ears ringing. Now was his chance! He leaped forward, punching the guard. The guard's head slammed into the side of the truck. Voznesensky turned and leapt from the back of the truck, tumbling on the ground. He shakily stood up, brushing himself off.\n\nThe truck had driven off, but he had to get away from here. Voznesensky turned down the first street he could, only to see a communist tank.. He tried to step back, hoping that he hadn't been noticed. The tank moved until the barrel of the gun was pointed at him. Voznesensky closed his eyes, knowing death was at hand. At least it would be quick."

 NIK.289.d:0 "It seems that despite our efforts, Svetlana Stalina has survived our attempt to assassinate her! Her guards were able to intervene before she was taken away by our soldiers, and she is now in a hidden location. Somehow, Stalina has managed to obtain access to a radio station, and has broadcasted all across Komi about our assassination attempt. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with many of the democrats decrying our underhanded methods, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown!

They pointed her guns at her, not even allowing her a chance to say a word before they grabbed her and put her in the back of an army truck. Shit. This was very bad. Was there any way for her to get out of this? Where had her guards gone? Stalina tried to figure out something, anything, but to no avail. After an hour, the truck stopped.\n\nStalina was escorted outside, into what appeared to be a small patch of forest, fairly distant from any life. Suddenly, it all became clear to Stalina what was going on. She was walking to her execution. Was there any way she could possibly escape? Stalina looked around, desperate. No. It seemed her death was inevitable. She took a deep breath.\n\nIf anything, Stalina would face her demise with dignity. After all, what else could she do? The soldiers stopped her. One of them offered a flask, filled with alcohol. She drank much more of it than she expected. It felt comforting, as much as liquor could possibly be. Stalina closed her eyes as the soldiers pointed their guns at her. She thought of her father, of the war, of everything she had done in Komi. Maybe in the end, it would be worth it. Maybe someone would rise to bring a better world to this mess of a planet. Maybe-\n\nStalina's thoughts ended, as the soldiers fired upon her."

His guards escorted him towards the back, checking each room and hallway for a communist. The gunfire intensified, as they approached the outside. There would be hell to pay, Gumilyov swore to himself. No communist bastard would attack him and get away with it.\n\nAs Gumilyov stepped outside, he was struck by the utter pandemonium. The gunfire was constant, and although his destination was only a few steps away, it took nearly 5 minutes before he could successfully enter his backup truck. Unmarked, it was perfect for a getaway. One of his guards tried to start the engine. It sputtered and failed. Gumilyov felt a sharp pang of fear as the guard tried again, the engine again failing to start. He could feel his heart beat faster and faster. The guard tried one more time, finally getting the engine to start. Gumilyov didn't have time to feel relieved, for he was overwhelmed by a bright flash, tearing him and the entire truck to shreds."

 NIK.293.t:0 "Expelling the Radicals"
 NIK.293.d:0 "As stability returns to the Republic, it is the government's responsibility to ensure the maintenance of order. The political radicalism that brought Syktyvkar to the brink of civil war cannot continue if Komi is to be the successor of the Russian nation. The democratic coalition needs to be able to identify and deal with extremists, and to do that it needs to delve deep into the government.\n\nThe radicals would never have gotten as far as they did if it had not been for a large network of sympathizers that penetrated wide segments of society, up to and including the government. Bureaucrats on the left and the right provided covert aid and deflected blame for their crimes. For a liberal republic to function, it cannot trust ideological opponents of democracy to run it.\n\nThe age-old question of liberty or security presents itself once again. The first option is to conduct limited sweeps, retaining especially experienced, trustworthy, or repentant officials. The second is to fire even all of those who were merely associated with the extremists, if only to be sure."
 NIK.293.a:0 "Only a dictator would persecute so many political opponents."

 NIK.294.t:0 "A Compromise Candidate"
 NIK.294.d:0 "Within the large democratic coalition formed in the aftermath of the coup and counter-coup, there are already tensions. The SMR, PSD, and DSNP are parties with great and substantial differences that are difficult to reconcile even with the necessity of a united front against radicalism. If they are allowed to simmer, these divisions may lead to the splintering of the coalition, a death sentence for Komi's fragile political order.\n\nEven symbolic overtures have value in these trying circumstances. To show good faith, the ruling party will replace the Vice President of the Republic with a representative of another party in order to emphasize the unity of the governing bloc in its respect for democratic values. As there are two subordinate parties, and obviously only one Vice President, the government will need to make a choice. Whose support is most necessary to ensure stability? Which party will have the President's ear, and which can safely be sidelined?"

 NIK.295.t:0 "Locking Down the Government"
 NIK.295.d:0 "While radicals don't believe in democracy, they will certainly take advantage of it. Either by entering the legislature or infiltrating the bureaucracy, they undermine the government from within to foment dissatisfaction among the people. Despite the ruling coalition's hard work, all it would take is a wave of radical candidates capitalizing on a disgruntled public to bring Komi crashing back down into chaos. Until the situation is under control, they must be frozen out by any means necessary.\n\nWhile not ideal, delaying elections and suspending appointments is a must for the short term. Blocking communists and fascists from the government will, over the long term, weaken them by denying them the platform they crave, and it will allow the democratic parties the time they need to stabilize the political situation. By carefully screening candidates, the government can ensure that officials seek to serve the people over their ideologies.\n\nThe state can see far, but it can't screen everyone. Perhaps it would be a better idea to focus on shutting down just the strongest organization's attempts to infiltrate the political system, rather than needlessly diluting its power. As both the left and right rebuild in silence, it may not be so easy to tell which one is the closest to striking again."

 NIK.296.t:0 "Outside Assistance?"
 NIK.296.d:0 "The political violence that shook Komi until recently has significantly depleted the supply of reliable soldiers. Large numbers of fighting-age men joined radical organizations and were consequently deemed unreliable for recruitment into the military. Outside of Komi, however, there is no shortage of men with many guns and few principles.\n\nVologda, with its supply of weapons and lack of severe politicization, has great potential as a source of soldiers, and a delegation of mercenaries from there has in fact already contacted the government, expressing willingness to fill the gaps in our security in exchange for generous compensation. They claim to be veterans of the West Russian War with a significant amount of experience and seemingly have no loyalties besides the pecuniary.\n\nWith anti-state sentiment as widespread as it is, mercenaries may be the most loyal force Komi can find on short notice. More importantly, the state is hardly in a position to turn them down. Nevertheless, some in the government argue that those who don't believe in its ideals cannot be trusted to protect democracy."

 NIK.296.b:0 "Our safety isn't for sale."

 NIK.297.t:0 "Traitors Among Us!"
 NIK.297.d:0 "There were those in the government who raised hell over the decision to hire mercenaries, calling it a close-minded, foolish move that would only endanger Komi in the long run. Recent events have more than earned them an apology.\n\nThe mercenaries hired from Vologda deserted only weeks after they arrived, citing low pay and unfair restrictions put on them by the state. To "compensate" themselves for their trouble, they carried off a treasure trove of loot from several of Syktyvkar's banks in the process. Their loyalty to the Republic was clearly illusory, but their military experience was very real, as they brutally demonstrated to a patrol sent out to stop them. Now, with fifteen casualties and a gaping hole in the front lines, the military situation is worse than before they were invited in.\n\nThe government will have its hands full trying to manage the public relations disaster in the coming weeks, but an even greater issue looms overhead: with too few soldiers and a clearly unreliable mercenary base, how will it defend the people of Komi?"
 NIK.297.a:0 "A military fiasco."

 NIK.298.t:0 "The Curfew"
 NIK.298.d:0 "The city of Syktyvkar has recently enacted a 9:00 PM curfew, for the sake of security and curbing radical activities. The reaction of the citizenry has been mixed to say the least. Komi's people have always had an uneasy relationship with their government, and while some dutifully obey the restrictions, others flout them en masse.\n\nThose working late shifts or making midnight shopping trips have no intention of going along with the new rules. This puts the government in an uneasy position. The curfew needs to be enforced if it is to have any effect on security, but asking already struggling people to neglect their livelihoods is obviously unfeasible. Is there a middle ground? How many restrictions are reasonable when the average person has only a small chance of coming into danger?\n\nThe opinions of the government are divided. The more liberally minded believe the current measures to be unreasonable and possibly counterproductive. Others believe them to be too lenient, and a third faction has tried to stake out a compromise, with armed escorts returning violators harmlessly to their homes."
 NIK.298.a:0 "Excessive policing will only harm public morale."
 NIK.298.b:0 "Armed escorts are both secure and flexible."
 NIK.298.c:0 "There's no such thing as too many night patrols."

 NIK.299.t:0 "Night Raids"
 NIK.299.d:0 "By this point, Komi's democratic hardliners must feel like Cassandra of Troy. Their warnings against a premature relaxation of the curfew were ignored by the government at its own peril, and they appear to have been proven right.\n\nThe decrease in policing following the lessening of restrictions caused an almost immediate uptick in violent crime and terrorism. Over twice as many incidents occur at night when compared to the period of extensive enforcement, and multiple government installations have fallen under attack by unseen elements. While concerns over the impact of heavy enforcement on civilians were understandable, they sorely underestimated the extent to which chaos still reigns on the streets of Syktyvkar. Now, as weeks of carefully earned progress start to unravel, the politicians who advocated for such measures have only themselves to blame.\n\nThe sole silver lining of this situation is a broader consensus that the government needs to take a firmer stance. If the hardliners' counsel falls on more receptive ears, future crises may be resolved with the appropriate amount of force."

Perhaps it could be more formal, but what was formality in these times? It certainly wasn't of any use at the moment, with the Assembly in total chaos and more than a few members dead or missing. Still, at least a semblance had to be maintained if the Republic's legitimacy was to be salvaged - for that, the PSD would need a respectable partner.\n\nA burst of gunfire in a distant street sounded through her office's sole window - a reminder of the urgency of her endeavour.

All standards and regulations which apply to that institution shall also apply to the Komi Police Force. The extant structure of the Komi Police Force shall be maintained, pending..."\n\nThe typewriter's clacking ceased as Stalina's fingers stopped in midair. She hadn't really considered reorganization when first formulating the idea of militarizing the police. It seemed logical - why put them under military command but maintain their same ineffectual structure? She leaned onto her desk, steepling fingers in thought. Subordinating the notoriously weak-willed police commanders to reliable military officers would probably provide better results, but the success of that move could not be guaranteed; the police were ferociously independent, after all. Perhaps a slower, more... organic approach might work? Of course, that would mean leaving the police and military to sort it out themselves. There was no guarantee that would work, either.

The effectiveness of the police has been severely hampered by these setbacks and radical civilian elements are running rampant with the army pre-occupied dealing with the paramilitaries.\n\nThe police chiefs are back to work and have set their men to putting out the fires, but our government's image has taken a severe hit from its failure to reorganize law enforcement. It will be weeks before the police are able to quell the consequent unrest."

 NIK.303.t:0 "Police Reorganization Greatly Successful!"
 NIK.303.d:0 "Grigorenko reports that he and the police chiefs have successfully hashed out a blueprint for a smooth, rational reorganization of the Komi Police Force into an arm of the military. Small concessions have been made to appease the understandably nervous police, but we have gained far more than we've ceded from this effort.\n\nPolice detachments are now learning to work effectively in tandem with army units and friendly paramilitaries. Civilian unrest is being rapidly quelled with the police no longer having to worry about attack by well-armed radical groups, providing a tremendous boost to morale."
 NIK.303.a:0 "Blue and green, working in harmony."

 NIK.304.t:0 "A Successful Reorganization"
 NIK.304.d:0 "Grigorenko reports that the Komi Police, having accepted President Stalina's orders without quarrel, have been successfully subordinated to his officers without too much trouble. There has been some grumbling at the sudden militarization of police ranks and conduct, but they understand their duty to the Republic.\n\nBoth civilian and paramilitary radicals are being pushed back throughout the Republic, with police and soldiers working together well. There remains much for them to do, but President Stalina's reorganization has made our security forces far more effective than they used to be."

However, her elation was short-lived as, once again, the sound of a large mob assembling outside reached her ears. Doubtless some radical sympathizer in the Assembly had caught wind of her intention to crack down on protests and spread it to the public. As of the moment she finished typing it, however, it had become law - one word to the head of security downstairs, and the rowdy plebs outside would be dispersed or otherwise dealt with.

 NIK.307.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nMikhail Andreyevich Suslov, de-facto head of the communists in our Republic, has been successfully arrested. Our informant's tip-off was correct - the Communist Party's headquarters was not in fact abandoned. A bunker beneath the building, probably dating back to the first German invasion, was serving as their base of operations. The main entrance, hidden in the building's archives room, was sealed. Our troops were forced to resort to explosives to breach it.\n\nFortunately, the communists had not been alerted to our discovery of the bunker. They were caught completely unaware by the assault team, who met minimal armed resistance and suffered no casualties. Some of the traitors were able to escape into tunnels exiting elsewhere in the city, but Suslov himself was still in his office when our troops found him. He had to be bloodied a little before being cuffed, but is in good health and awaiting your judgement.\n\nLong live the Republic!"

The tip-off our informant provided was correct; we successfully located the bunker underneath the Community Party headquarters. However, someone must have also tipped off the Reds to our approach. When the assault team breached the bunker, all they found were empty rooms. The armory, archives and offices were all stripped bare, leaving only things like furniture behind.\n\nThere were a dozen tunnels leading out of the bunker, exiting all over the city, so there's no indication of where Suslov might have fled to. Knowing him, he probably has several bolt-holes in every district. We've no idea where to begin searching. Awaiting further orders."

 NIK.309.t:0 "The Execution of Mikhail Suslov"
 NIK.309.d:0 "Frigid Ural winds drew moisture from Suslov's eyes as the bag was finally ripped from his head. Blinking and looking around, he saw his guards arrayed in a circle around him, faces stony and eyes filled with contempt. Beyond them was... trees? No, a forest. That must have been why they disembarked from the truck hours ago and continued on foot to wherever Stalina had ordered them. They had travelled by road for at least six hours, so they were clearly some distance from Syktyvkar. Yet, the President herself had not accompanied them. Perhaps the cause was not yet lost...\n\n"Gentlemen," he began. "Please, consider for a moment what you have been-"He got no further. Something hard cracked against his skull, causing him to stagger forward and bump against a guard, who shoved him back. "Shut up," spat the sergeant, who stepped forward and produced a small scrap of paper from his pocket. "Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, you have been accused of operating an illegal paramilitary, theft of state secrets, 71 counts of blackmail, 342 counts of conspiracy to murder, one count of murder-"\n\nSuslov sputtered, words finally failing him. "Tha... this is preposter-"\n\nThe sergeant paused for a moment as someone else slugged Suslov in the side. "Thanks, Ilya. You are also accused of acting as a hostile agent and carrying out acts of espionage for a foreign power in attempts to subvert the laws and constitution of the Republic of Komi. The court finds you guilty, and sentences you to be shot."\n\nSuslov blanched, a ghost in the fading light trickling through the canopy overhead. He opened his mouth to speak - then heard the distinct sound of an AK being cocked. "What do you think you're..." The rifle cracked, but there was no sudden crunch of Suslov's skull shattering. Instead, he toppled to the ground with a gasp as the bullet punched through his tattered shirt and deep into his gut.\n\nHis world faded into a blur of browns and greens as someone kicked his glasses away and crushed them underfoot. Then the pain hit - a sudden, unbearable rising of blood and bile from the core of his body. Suslov screamed as he felt the lump of hot lead lodged somewhere beneath his stomach. "You fucking bastards! Just... god- FUCK!" The blurs of grey standing above him began to move out of sight, their footsteps muffled on the layer of moss and fallen leaves. "NO! No, don't... don't just leave me here! What-?"\n\n"That's all you get, you rat," someone called back to him as they moved further away. "Let's see you slip out of this one.""

 NIK.310.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nLev Nikolayevich Gumilov, leader of the so-called 'Passionarists' is in our custody after some mild difficulties. As you suspected, he was still in the city itself, probably to coordinate the rightist paramilitaries. He was running his operations out of a district post office previously thought secure. Recon informed us that the building was heavily defended by concealed machine gun positions, so a stealthy approach was out of the question. We rolled up a BT-76, which drew their fire and kept them suppressed as our assault teams moved in.\n\nHeavy fighting followed the breach. Assault teams reported final tallies as five of ours wounded and two killed, with all twenty-four enemy combatants neutralized. Gumilov was cornered in the postmaster's office, but took us all by surprise when he threw himself through the window rather than be taken by our men. It wasn't much of a fall, but he was bleeding quite badly. The medics patched him up just fine - at least, once our boys had stopped kicking him for giving them the runaround. He's now in a cell with a medic on standby.\n\nLong live the Republic!"

The rightist paramilitaries provided much tougher opposition than we expected. They might even have been expecting us. When we surrounded the old post office they were hiding in, we thought they were just cornered rats. But something went wrong - like our recon had it completely wrong. We only expected to face machine gun nests and a platoon or two, but they'd turned that place into a damn fortress. We brought in a PT-76 to take out the MGs, but they had enough RPGs to turn it into burning scrap in the space of thirty seconds.\n\nWe suffered too much attrition, got too frustrated. The assault teams got reckless and tried to advance without cover - got torn to pieces. We didn't have the numbers to keep fighting when the rightists staged a breakthrough in a couple of trucks and sped off to another district. Gumilov must have been with them, since we found some of his personal effects in the building but no sign of the man himself. I'm sorry, ma'am - we just couldn't catch up to them."

His suit was already little more than black and white rags after the fall through his office window and the subsequent beating at the hands of Stalina's men. Did that bitch expect him to stand trial looking like this?\n\nEvery pair of eyes he passed turned to Gumilyov as he was half-dragged down the cold, dim concrete hallway. Rightist militiamen crowded into cells stood in silence, while their leftist neighbours jeered and shouted obscenities at the ragged man who had once been their most dangerous foe. "Popular, aren't you?" quipped the man holding Gumilyov's right arm. "Sorry you aren't going to have an audience for the next event. We're keeping this a low-key affair. Probably more suitable for a man of your standing, don't you think?"\n\nGumilyov didn't make a sound. Even without the gag wound tightly around his head, he wouldn't have dignified their chatter with a response. He just stared ahead into the gloom, closing off his ears to the din of the prisoners and guards all around him. Individual voices faded into an indistinct cacophony as he rounded a corner.\n\nAfter that moment, nobody ever saw Lev Gumilyov again - save for the guards who slit his throat, threw him into a shallow grave and riddled his prone form with bullets until their guns clicked empty."

After the first few were empty, we started to lose hope, but then one of the assault teams assigned to the warehouse district radioed in to say they'd got him. Funny thing, too, actually - his guards were the ones who turned him over to us. Apparently they'd had enough of him. We still had to arrest them, of course, but we've agreed not to charge them with anything. I hope you will accept that deal, ma'am.\n\nZhdanov is in a cell now - a padded one, mind you. Something's snapped in that man. He wouldn't stop ranting, so we gagged him. Kept struggling, so we gave him a beating. Got back up after a while, so we brought in a doctor who said he needed to be put in a straitjacket. That was too much bother, so we've just got him tied to a chair for now. Personally, I would ask that we deal with him as quickly as possible so he stops harassing the guards every time they walk past.\n\nLong live the Republic!"

There's a nice drop there."\n\nThe prisoner had recovered somewhat by the time the trio finally came to a halt - enough, at least, to begin ranting again.

Stalina will-"\n\n"Pipe down, dickhead," muttered one of his guards - which, Zhdanov couldn't tell. "Now, uh..." There was a sound of crinkling paper and a throat being cleared. "Andrei... fuck, can't read this handwriting for shit. Whatever. Andrei Zhdanov, you've been charged with blackmail, conspiracy to murder, um... treason..."\n\n"Abram, it's just us here. You don't have to read the whole damn thing. Let's just finish him off already."\n\nBeneath the sack, Zhdanov's face blanched and his eyes bulged. Without the covering, he might have been taken for a madman. "No, please! Please, both of you, just listen to me! Stalina, that crazy bitch, she's going to run Russia off a fucking cliff!"\n\n"No," replied one of the guards. "That would be you, Comrade Zhdanov."

There weren't many people who caved under pressure, even when we had irrefutable proof they'd been in contact with her.\n\nWe did get her in the end, though. One of Suslov's cronies spilled the information, said she was a threat to the unity of the Communist Party. Wonder what his boss would think of that.

In a corner, out of sight and out of mind, a truck was parked with a single wooden coffin in the flatbed. Everything else had been cleared away save for the post to which the traitor would be tied. The firing squad was silent, standing at ease yet visibly uncomfortable; they'd never shot a woman before.\n\nBukharina was led out of the cell block precisely on schedule, five minutes after the firing squad had arrived and been given time to prepare. It was best, the President had decided, for this particular operation to be carried out as quickly and cleanly as possible, given its nature. What made it distinct had not been elucidated to the warden, but he was an old servant of the law and was not given to questioning his orders.\n\nThe firing squad was brought to attention the moment Bukharina appeared. This, the warden understood the necessity of. Best not to let them be in an unprofessional mindset when the time came, unlike with the previous executions. This could be an unusually difficult task for them, given the woman's relative distance from the most extreme elements of her party.\n\nBukharina kept her eyes cast downwards as she was marched to the post and tied firmly in position. No prayer escaped her lips, and no unsurmountable terror set her to quivering.\n\n"No, thank you," she murmured with a grim expression as the warden produced a blindfold from his pocket. Stowing the strip of soft fabric, he hesitated for a moment before producing a small silver flask and unscrewing the cap. He offered it to her with an expectant look, no malice in his eyes. Bukharina smiled sadly and nodded. The warden brought it to her lips, allowing her to enjoy a deep quaff - one last taste of home before the end.\n\nThe warden replaced his flask and stepped away. The first rays of sunlight crept over the prison walls. "Firing squad!" he shouted clearly in the cold morning air. "Ready!"\n\nThe men snapped to with drilled precision. The warden's voice echoed around the yard, bouncing off the stone walls. Bukharina inhaled, deeply and slowly.\n\n"Take aim!" She exhaled, feeling the weight of years flow out of her with her last breath. Uncertainty, fear and doubt left her mind. Only clarity remained - and the sense that she had always tried to do the right thing. Others would carry her torch. That was enough for her.\n\n"Fire!""

It echoes in formerly busy market-square, stilling the lively tongues of the merchants who have come from all over Syktyvkar's environs. The rumors have begun to spread, and they cannot be suppressed. Volgoda has refused, it is said. On all sides Komi is embattled, and the armies grow ever closer in the black night, like a sheet, over the borders.\n\nIt grasps the hearts of senior citizens who watch the false-cheerfulness of the news and look into long-darkened closets, wondering if the old firearms are still working and if their aim is as sharp in their old age as it was at the first. So too the hearts of soldiers and generals, stifling their cheer and dulling the gleam of their boots. No one is willing to say what they really think, but all are looking to their old homes, and to reprieve in gentle obscurity. There is a time coming when they will no longer have the luxury of the former.\n\nThere is a cold silence, too, in the leadership. The options of the Republic have run dry. There is no one coming to save them, and what good is a government if it cannot look its people in the eye and tell them that things will, in due course, get better? The staffers, of course, are forbidden from even discussing such things. It scarcely matters. Just as ravens sense the coming of a storm, so too can the public sense the inexorable approach of a problem Komi can no longer deal with.\n\nIn a village to the south of Syktyvkar, children play the timeless games of all children everywhere: they run, aiming mock pistols and bows at each other, giggling as they hide behind walls and bushes. A mother, watching them, fingers the pistol in her own handbag. Perhaps, one day, she will take her child to the range, and should he ask why she will merely whisper into his ear, with the grace of someone who can no longer protect her love:"

 NIK.324.d:0 "Serov's newly-established Komi National Army, reformed from the ashes of the inefficient Republican armed forces, have been mobilized and are already acting to secure the streets around the national assembly in Syktyvkar. As trucks enter the city limits and shots are fired, we are currently in limbo as Serov's loyalists attempt to extend their authority throughout the city - with no Syktyvkar, there is no control throughout the rest of the republic, and if not handled carefully, everything could come crashing down.\n\nThe protestors that are staring down the barrels of our guns are just as adamant about removing Serov as Serov is about removing them. However - now that the National Army is prioritizing securing the streets of Syktyvkar and cauterizing the city, the commanders of the armed forces are of two minds in how to proceed with dispersing the protestors.\n\nThe first proposal, the more obvious one, is to use the might of the Komi National Army to break the protestors, disperse them with violence and street combat. This will ensure, of course, that the army demonstrates who is in control, but it will also likely cause unnecessary death in an army already stretched for manpower.\n\nThe second option proposes that Serov and the army send civilian infiltrators, associated with the military or Serov's supporters, into the protestors and ingratiate themselves with those who organized the protests. When the time is right, the infiltrators will wreak havoc and collapse their organization. What should we do?"

Others, however, have pointed out that doing so would hurt our already-fragile control over the government.\n\nBy not negotiating with the militias in control of the arsenal, we may not have access to the tear gas that could be instrumental in suppressing these protests, but if we avoid using the gas, even if it means more pain for us now, we may gain some legitimacy in the eyes of the people."

It was addressed to Sergei Taboritsky, leader of the Society for the Restoration of the Russian Empire, a minor right-wing faction. However, Taboritsky also had his elite stormtroopers, fanatics who would gladly die for their leader and his cause. Taboritsky was fanatic in his loyalty to Tsar Alexei II, who he believed escaped execution by the Bolsheviks. This posed a number of problems for Gumilyov. Firstly, Tsar Alexei II was almost certainly dead, so Taboritsky's mental health could be called into question. This meant he could be unreliable. Secondly, Gumilyov was not a monarchist, he doesn't care for the Tsars, and he honestly just doesn't like Taboritsky.\n\nIn his letter, Gumilyov worked around their differences, appealing to Taboritsky's desire to see Russia's borders expanded to their peak under the Empire. Some of these claims were natural: Retaking Moscow, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, among others. Gumilyov also made some more extravagant claims, including hinting at the possible annexation of Alaska. Gumilyov felt ridiculous proposing such a thing, but Taboritsky seemed like the kind of man who would make such extravagant claims.\n\nWas all of this really worth it? Taboritsky possessed some very elite paramilitaries, but were they necessary in order to overthrow the Republic? Taboritsky was also a strong orator, with a decent support base. Including the monarchists in Gumilyov's coup could lead to a power struggle if he failed to keep them in check. Gumilyov still held the letter in his hand, he could just tell his assistant to burn the thing, and just do without Taboritsky's monarchists.

He could use his newfound power as leader of the Republic to expand the conscription laws, although it could cause some unrest, and there was no guarantee of quality. Or, Gumilyov could, despite his dislike for the man, ask Sergei Taboritsky to lend his elite stormtroopers to the Eurasian National Army, who would form the core of his new military.\n\nThe obvious problem with this plan was that the stormtroopers were, above all else, loyal to Taboritsky. They may swear allegiance to some long-dead Tsar, but Taboritsky was their de facto leader. If he relied on Taboritsky's stormtroopers too much, Taboritsky could use his influence over them in order to take power.\n\nThis choice was effectively a question of quality vs quantity. Expanding conscription would give him quantity, although they would likely take longer to be trained, and likely wouldn't be as effective as the stormtroopers. The stormtroopers may be comparatively few in number, and possibly politically dissident, but their fanaticism made them a terrifyingly effective force."

Perhaps they have little on their mind besides the usual concerns of the semi-involved unionists, but with a little training, who knows what they could be capable of? On that optimistic note, he opens the letter.\n\nDisbelief gives way to anger, and then to cold understanding. Zhdanov picks up the phone to call the Party headquarters, but on their end there is nothing, not even a respondent to field calls. In a huff, he marches to the door, to be met by the measured tones of Suslov himself.\n\nSuslov stares through his misted glasses, his eyes cold, his face closeted - and triumph in his voice, unmistakeable at last."

Grey-faced, grey-suited, effectively faceless - the very definition of the Party suit. And yet they speak the language of power, Suslov's only tongue, as well as he does.\n\nIt is power now that the clique gathers to speak. Talk is brief and to the point: there have been an anomalous number of intrusions on what could be said - what would surely be said, had the majority been properly guided by its betters - by people who seem less than interested in the Party Line. Indeed, these people seem altogether interested in taking Democracy out of Democratic Centralism, on usurping the Party for their own functions. And who can trust an unknown in these trying times?\n\nSuslov nods. It is time to move past the rhetoric to the only thing that matters. He proposes, in the tones of a bored schoolmaster resolving a playground dispute, a suspension to certain members of the Party, including the esteemed Bukharina and Zhdanov. A suspension that, of course, will be temporary, and is intended entirely for their own benefit and that of the Body Politic.\n\nSuslov keeps his lips tightly guarded, but he cannot suppress a twitch in his cheek.

Here and there what appeared to be the angular form of planes - rockets, perhaps? - arose from the scintillating mist around them, nestled in the ocean of red font like Venus of Botticelli.\n\nAnd at the bottom of it all a slogan: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW WITH TODAY'S SOCIALISM - FOLLOW THE ZHDANOVISM LINE.\n\nEvanoff sniffed. They'd have to do better if they wanted to impress the headmaster of the Kotlas School for Young Artists. Dipping a sponge into her bucket of water, she began to scrub the amateurish enthusiasm away. Perhaps their next work would be more inspired, or at least less excessive in its use of outlines.\n\nThe next week the propaganda was back, bolder and more garish than ever. The arsonist, whoever they were, had evidently reacted by doubling down. Bolder and crazier the red mist foamed in every corner. New symbols of progress, arrows reaching ever upwards, lifted atop a sea of crimson arms and hands holding hammers. Above them all, a rocket bearing the spindly wheels of the atom rose like Jupiter into shaded red sun-rays.\n\nThe slogan had at least been shortened. ZHDANOV TODAY - THE STARS TOMORROW!\n\nMs Evanoff stared and stared, and then she began to giggle. It was so bold, it was almost endearing.

When Serov had presented his theories to him and Comrade Zhdanov, Suslov was optimistic. Though Serov was inarguably a brute, he was a loyal one, and wasn't ignorant of Marxism. Though Suslov didn't quite expect the second coming of Lenin, he hoped that the ex-NKVD chief would at least demonstrate some knowledge of socialism.\n\nInstead, he found horror. Suslov sighed and shuffled through the papers once again, the churning in his gut only intensifying. Nothing about the Manifesto was inherently wrong or reactionary, but Serov's wording, particularly in regard to what he referred to as "Hereditary Reactionaries," suggested something far more sinister than simple Theory laid under the surface of the manifesto.\n\nSuslov pushed himself away from his desk, stood quickly, hands quivering, and called for a messenger."

"This... Theory of yours." He paused.\n\nSerov saw an opportunity - perhaps if he spoke fast enough, he could explain the revelations he had come to. "I -"\n\n"You." Suslov spoke sharply, losing all pretense of neutrality. Again, Serov felt a dagger in his stomach. "These musings of yours, Comrade Serov, they suggest you are dreadfully misinformed about several things. You have been called here not for punishment - not yet -, but so we may correct this error."\n\nIf it was anyone else before him, Serov would sharply challenge the notion that he wasn't being censured - but as he gazed into the cold steel of Suslov's eyes, words seemed to fail.\n\nFor what seemed like hours, Suslov tore apart Serov's beloved Manifesto, and in the end calmly banned him from spreading it under threat of party expulsion.\n\nAnother, weaker man would take this lying down, but Serov was not a weak man. He didn't sleep that night or the next, like a weak man would.\n\nInstead he wrote, feverishly, almost maniacally. In the end, it would be worth it. Suslov would see soon just how wrong he was."

No traces of blank white paper remained on the letter he held, only the erratic ravings of a man scorned. If the Manifesto of Ordosocialism flirted with revisionism, this new monstrosity was practically wed to Reaction. He read with horror at first as Serov detailed the valuable lessons to be learned from 'the thus-far superior ideology of the German,' and how the Communist Party would do well to 'adapt the tactics of victory,' which, as far as Serov seemed concerned, referred mostly to the extermination of 'Hereditary Reactionaries', state-sponsored corporations, and a promotion of German racial theory.\n\nSuslov nearly slammed the paper onto his desk, hand quivering, not with horror, but now with rage as visions of German Tanks and Camps flashed through his mind. A snarl snaked across his lips as he pushed himself to his feet. Serov had gone too far. This was not the questions of an uneducated socialist, but the deranged lunacy of a fascist.\n\nSuslov barely noticed his surroundings as he stormed through his office and punched a number into his telephone.

Zhdanov, to his credit, had nearly immediately arrived at headquarters and agreed to sign the letter of expulsion, something Suslov took precious satisfaction with. Though he could feel the growing distance between his old mentor and himself every day, at least they stood united tonight against Reaction.\n\nZhdanov placed the pen on the table and gestured towards Suslov as he approached.

They had made the fatal error of approaching a company whose ranks were dominated by old Soviet veterans, and for that mistake they were set upon by the irritated and godless. It had taken the intervention of the Military Police to set them apart.\n\nA priest, lip still bleeding but head unbowed, rose to speak. "This is a travesty - that the David of Russia, the bearer of the Mantle of God, shall have the Godless as his servants and his conquerors? This is a spiritual crisis. We demand the right to administer His medicine."\n\nA general rose to speak, still trembling slightly from his age. "My men would follow the orders of our State anywhere, but to impose upon them a Church they reject is a sure path to disaster! I ask for the moderation we have always seen in you. There must be a better way to build Russia anew than to hang the Cross upon the necks of all its subjects.""

 NIK.371.t:0 "Rebuilding The Monasteries?"
 NIK.371.d:0 "The territory once owned by the Order of Saint George has fallen under our control, and our forces have begun to restore order to the area. As with all conquests that we succeed in, different regional questions must be addressed for different areas, and Gayny is no exception. The Order, as the name implies, was highly religious, and much of their funds were poured into monasteries and churches. Over time, however, many of these houses of worship have decayed, whether from natural elements, stray bullets and shells, or German bombs- the constant among them being that most are in a state of disrepair.\n\nThe Right in Komi is predominantly religious, excluding Serov's clique, but the topic of funding to repair the churches has struck a nerve. Arguments fly back and forth between each side- those for it claim that, even ignoring the obvious religious reasons, such a move would undoubtedly win favor from the local populace. Those against it argue that such funding would be better spent on state matters, such as the military. In the end, a decision must be made- who matters more, God or the State?"

 NIK.372.d:0 "Finally, the Red scourge has been purged from Western Russia. The hammer and sickle no longer waves over Archangelesk, but instead lies where it belongs- ripped and trampled, covered with mud and grime. It is the only place where such a perverse, backwards symbol should lie. Many things will come of this new development, but one of the most important is the trial of the Red Army, as it should have been a half-century ago. However, an interesting situation has cropped up- one that requires our attention.\n\nIt has always been a habit of the Bolshevik to betray their nation, and it seems that this phenomenon has cropped up yet again. Numerous Red officers, when told of what they would be tried for, seem to have had a sudden ideological change of heart. These rats in uniform seem to be more than willing to switch sides, betraying their old friends for a new job and a shot at survival.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that these men- if they can be called such- will be any more loyal to our army than their old haunts, the Army can always use experienced officers. Letting those who repent collaborate may be a controversial move, but it would certainly be a boost for our relatively green soldiers. The choice comes down to our leadership."

 NIK.373.d:0 "Vyatka, after a long struggle, is under our domain. Years of animosity between us and them have come to a head in a climactic struggle- one that, thankfully, we have won. However, the years of monarchist rule in the region has left its culture decidedly Tsarist- something that part of our faction has decided to use to their advantage.\n\nTaboritsky's clique has begun a push to have him nominated as the Grand Duke of Vyatka. While there's no real harm done by granting him his request- outside of some extra legitimacy for his way of viewing things- some within our faction have pushed against this move, claiming it's merely a waste of time and tying ourselves to the Tsarist days. The decision must be made."

 NIK.374.d:0 "The Mladorossi are fascists, so they claim. For years, they have staked out on the eastern end of Vyatka, managing their own little patch of dirt with their unorthodox beliefs. However, Vyatka is gone, and the territory of Berezniki is under our command. The question that has plagued multiple warlords over the years now falls to us- what do we do about the Mladorossi?\n\nOn the one hand, their beliefs- as unorthodox as they may be- do mostly fall in with at least some of the Komi Right. They could make good political partners in the region. On the other hand, some of their other beliefs directly clash with some of the closest held beliefs of our own- some even whisper that they are Bolsheviks under a coat of white paint. Though such allegations are certainly exaggerations, they must be taken into account.\n\nIn the end, this decision may not change the face of Russia forever, but it will certainly play a helping role for one faction or another, depending on what the fate of the Mladorossi is."

 NIK.375.d:0 "Viktor's truck slid to a halt at the gate of the villages, and his men leapt from the back[. In a moment, they stomped over to the gate, testing it. When they found it was locked, a short burst from a PPSH split the lock apart, and the soldiers marched in, followed by truck after truck.\n\nViktor watched as his men pulled the villagers from their homes, dragging them to the village square. Soldiers swept the dirt roads, looking for anyone foolish enough to hide or fight. If they hid, they'd catch an extra kick in the ribs before being dragged to the square. If they fought, a sharp staccato of fire would be all they received. Eventually, once Viktor was satisfied with the number of citizens gathered, he left his truck and marched in front of the local mosque, surrounded by his soldiers.\n\n"Citizens!" He began. "From this day forth, you are no longer Tatars. You are Russians! You will speak Russian, you will read Russian, and you will discard your old culture immediately or face punishment! We shall personally see to it that not a single trace of this "Tatar" culture is shown in this region again! Is that understood?"\n\nBefore the crowd had a chance to respond, Viktor waved his arm, and a hail of Molotov cocktails crashed through the mosque's windows and lit the floor on fire. As smoke began to rise behind him, Viktor smiled. His job was complete."
 NIK.375.a:0 "We are all Russians, like it or not."

 NIK.376.t:0 "The Conversion Of Bashkiria"
 NIK.376.d:0 "Our efforts to secure Tatarstan have begun in earnest. The roads are filled with trucks driving from village to village, tearing down the old Tatar flags and symbols and replacing them with our flag. All seems to be well so far, but an issue has cropped up- the issue of religion.\n\nThe Tatar people are Muslims, and our soldiers are overwhelmingly not. This has led to much friction- both in the region itself and at home. Three distinct wings have broken apart on the issue. The first pushes for an immediate focus on converting the Tatars to Christianity. After all, they claimed, it is our duty as honest Christians to bring non-believers back into the fold. This would be costly and take much time to complete, but could be worth it in the end. The second wing pushes for simply crushing Islam altogether- burning mosques, prosecuting imams, and destroying the religious presence in the area as a whole. This is a controversial idea, but would be easier than conversion- though the Tatars would certainly be unhappy. Finally, some have proposed simply leaving religion untouched- the simplest, easiest option. Of course, with much of the Right being religious themselves, this is a controversial position to take. In any case, we must act, and act swiftly."

 NIK.377.t:0 "Shafarevich Splits!"
 NIK.377.d:0 "Shafarevich dropped his pen with a sigh, regarding his latest letter. It was, quite possibly, the most important letter of his political career- a make or break moment for him. Enclosed inside would be what would crack the Right in half. Shafarevich was splitting- forming his own group inside the Passionariyy.\n\nShafaverich and Gumiylov had never seen eye to eye on everything, of course, and perhaps this split was inevitable. The main force binding them together beforehand had been a mutual distrust of the Center and Left, after all. Without either of those posing a serious challenge, the cracks had widened into chasms, and it was no longer expedient- or really even tenable- to maintain the alliance. Across the Right, the pieces fall, as Passionariyy members proclaim their loyalty to one side or the other.\n\nMost importantly, however, was which way Serov and Taboritsky would fall. Though neither commanded nearly as much influence as Shafaverich or Gumiylov, their support could be the push that would make or break one side's plan. These thoughts all rushed through Shafarevich's mind as he handed the letter to his secretary- now was the hour where Russia's future would be decided."
 NIK.377.a:0 "The real game begins."

 NIK.378.t:0 "The New Vows"
 NIK.378.d:0 "An interesting question has risen through the ranks of the Passionairyy once again- who do we swear our allegiance to? It's never been much of a problem before, when the Komi Right was just that- a political allegiance, confined only to the Komi Republic- but now that our realm is beginning to dominate Western Russia, it's becoming much more of a hot topic among the various factions that make up our power base.\n\nTaboritsky's group, as is common with them, are pushing for a decidedly monarchist vow- one that swears allegiance to the Tsar. Shafaverich, ever the populist, is pushing for the vow to be for the people. Serov himself is pushing for the oath to be to the state. FInally, Gumilyov has used his influence to try and get the oath to not be to the people, nor the state, nor the Tsar, but rather Eurasia as a whole. Each of these groups are using this moment to try and gain influence- an annoying habit of theirs, but in such a tense political environment, it's only expected. In any case, we shall swear allegiance to. . . "

Taboritsky, for his own part, held himself quite well in the face of such an intimidating figure. Both seemed to almost study the other, attempting to find what the ulterior motive of such a meeting must be. Finally, Taboritsky spoke.\n\n"Is this some sort of joke, Serov?" He questioned quietly, his gaze unmoving. Serov looked right back at him, unwavering. His voice sliced through the air like a sword- cold, swift, and deadly.\n\n"No, Sergei. This is no joke. I am entirely serious." Taboritsky cocked an eyebrow.\n\n"What do you mean? There's nothing in common between us. Ideologically, we-"\n\n"I know all about our ideological differences." Serov leaned in. "But we do have one thing in common. We're on the outside looking in. Those bastards Gumiylov and Shafarevich think that it's a two horse race. Why don't we work together, get rid of them, and then sort it out between us?"\n\nTaboritsky didn't expect the brutal honesty, but he couldn't say he disagreed. He smiled- it almost looked more like a grimace- and offered his hand for a shake. Serov looked down, and a smile slowly crept along his mouth."

 NIK.380.d:0 ""Ivan Serov. A pleasure to see you, as always." Shafarevich smiled, relaxing in his chair. Serov was nowhere near as loose, instead standing rigidly in front of the desk. "So." Shafarevich continued. "What is it you wish to see me about?"\n\n"Igor, you know as well as I do that the fate of the party is soon at hand. Gumiylov, Taboritsky, you and I are all competing for leadership. However, the prospect of a Gumiylov or Taboritsky-led Passionairyy. . .worries me. Gumilyov is a lunatic, and Taboritsky- I cannot tell if Taboritsky is high half of the time."\n\n"My god, you really are quite blunt, are you?" Shafarevich chuckled. "And what about me, Serov? I know that we disagree on many points. What makes you so receptive to me, rather than the others?"\n\n"I don't particularly like you, Igor." Serov leaned forward. "I just don't want to see my head on a pike, you understand?"\n\nShafaverich nodded. "I understand. It's a deal.""

 NIK.381.t:0 "The Re-United Passionariyy"
 NIK.381.d:0 "Shafaverich's posture, though he maintained a poker face worthy of Vegas, betrayed him. Gumilyov noticed the nervous hands clasped together, the slight slump, the tapping foot. His eyes flickered up and down before he began. "What are you doing in my office, Igor?"\n\n"Lev, I know we're not on the best of terms-" Gumiylov cocked an eyebrow. "But you're the best option we have."\n\n"I thought you split from my party for a reason, Igor." Lev stated. "Why would you come back to me now?"\n\n"Serov and Taboritsky are lunatics, Lev. They're insane. They'll drive the whole country off a cliff, and they'll kill us all while they're at it. You see that, right? We don't agree on much, but for the sake of our country, can we not come together, just this once?"\n\nLev looked him over again. Did he really need Shafarevich? He could win alone just as well as with Igor. However, the chance of Taboritsky or Serov winning, small as it may be, was simply too much of a risk to leave up to fate. Perhaps it wouldn't last too long after the conference, but it worked before. Perhaps it could work again."

The last time he could remember himself smiling- genuinely smiling, not just the crocodile smile he gave to those he needed for his plans- was at his desk long ago, writing out his masterpiece. He could remember the ecstasy of the final tap of the typewriter, and he could remember the crushing blow of Suslov, rather than even taking a moment to truly think about his writings, casting it aside out of hand. If only old Mikhail could see him now!\n\nHe had worked hard in the last years. Going from the Left to the Right was nearly unheard of, and it took much time for them to trust him as one of their own. He was no fascist, not at all. At heart, he was still a socialist- just not one of those doddering fools or naive idealists who seemed to think that slapping the same red coat of paint on Russia would be enough to win. He knew better. Maybe Russia hadn't wanted to accept it then, but they were going to accept it now. He would make them.\n\nAnd so, as chaos swept the floor of the National Assembly, and men leapt from their seats in astonishment at what was thought to be impossible, Serov allowed himself a genuine smile."

Shafarevich had been the young face of the Passionariyy, and had been expected to have a long career in front of him.\n\nOf course, events changed all that, and suddenly Shafaverich found himself not as second in command to one faction among many, but second in the leaders of Komi. This was not a position he particularly wanted, and his split from Gumiylov's wing drew much attention. Most analysts agreed, however- Shafarevich had made his move too early. His bid for power would come up short, and then he'd surely be in for it.\n\nWhen the vote count was finished, and Shafaverich was named the new head of state, the National Assembly fluttered with confusion and mild surprise. It was nowhere near the shock of what would have happened from a Serov or Taboritsky victory, but it was enough to surprise many.

What was much more interesting was the events immediately afterwards.\n\nSerov and Taboritsky both rose from their chairs and made their exits- Taboritsky nearly dashing to the exit, while Serov at least had the brains to keep his mask of calm up as he left. No doubt, Gumiylov thought as he watched them go, they were going to try and cause trouble. He sighed- just another thing to hang them for. His eyes flicked to Shafaverich, who had not left. What was he to do with him? It would take longer to get rid of a man as popular as Igor, but it would be done, eventually. Soon enough, Gumiylov would be alone at the top, and the Eurasianist dream could finally be realized.\n\nAs truck engines outside roared into the distance, Gumiylov's joyous demeanor finally returned, and his heart stopped beating so hard.

The rest of the Assembly was stunned into silence- not even able to voice their shock and disbelief.\n\n"Is this some sort of joke?" Gumiylov asked, the color draining from his face. The man at the center shook his head. Shafeverich and Gumilyov shared a look- terror, perhaps, or disbelief- and turned back to the man. It couldn't be true.\n\nAnd then, they began to leave.\n\nIt started as a trickle of shell-shocked representatives before the dam broke, a cacophony of footsteps desperate to get out of the way of the hell that was soon to come. Serov and Taboritsky watched the fleeing masses before their eyes locked onto each other. Gumiylov and Shafaverich were gone, thrown into the trashcan of history- the question now was whether Taboritsky or Serov would follow them.

Their gambit had worked. They had won. They had secured the future of their movement, and they had shut out the NKVD thug and the delusional tsarist. As he knew deep down that they would. This was their movement after all.\n\nThe defeated candidates wasted little time in rallying their supporters and leaving the assembly. They would have to be dealt with, of course.

With his military connections, it seemed obvious that the final struggle between the two would be somewhat slanted towards him, and the confrontation was indeed brief.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, several reported awakening to the sound of gunshots, and multiple military and paramilitary forces "occupying" several locations ranging from homes to pivotal roads, with several of Taboritsky's deputies being awoken and dragged out at gunpoint. As for Taboritsky himself, rumors abound to his exact location, though most agree that he is no longer in Komi.\n\nSerov is now the undisputed master of the Republic - though with his former allies gone, one can question how much his power base has been afflicted by their removal. Solidifying his grip over Komi is doubtless the first thing on his agenda, and while his supporters cheer... others fear for their lives."

Masked men were seen breaking into the residences of Serov's closest supporters and taking them away to an unknown location. The action has proven a decisive one, as most of Serov's inner circle seems to have been seized successfully, the rest having gone into hiding and Serov himself also missing. There are multiple rumours surrounding his whereabouts spreading, but a growing number of reports agree he's fled Ust-Sysolsk.\n\nThere can be little doubt that Taboritsky is now the master of the state. With his erstwhile allies gone, however, their fates unknown except to their captors, his base of support appears precariously diminished. Whether he can keep the power he's secured remains to be seen."

Small private meetings. All with similar guests, and all with similar phrases. "I will protect the proletariat." "I will restore socialism." "I will keep the traditions of the past alive." Despite the similar gatherings and similar guests however, the responses are different. To some of his pleas he gains nods of acquiescence, while others reply with questions, or cold defiance.\n\nAnd yet, he continues. Why? Perhaps he's genuine. Perhaps he never left the party at all, and perhaps Suslov got him wrong. Perhaps he's looking for men he can get brief support from, and then depose of them when he no longer needs them. Or - perhaps he's simply opportunistic, willing to bend whatever way will get him power. No one knows but Serov.\n\nWhat is known to all however, is that this is a risky gamble."

They say private enterprises will complement their state-run counterparts to provide greater welfare for all. The best way to achieve both would be to provision for private property rights in our constitution while also specifying that it can be overruled and under what conditions.\n\nThere are many, however, who believe we can only realize our plans under a total command economy. Everything in the republic belongs to the whole nation, and it is only right that the nation be empowered to mobilize every farmer, worker and clerk to achieve its aims. Private businesses will always, by their very nature, undermine this aim. The constitution should, according to this faction, define all property as belonging to the state.\n\nTaboritsky's faction advocates a third approach. They say that it is these modern economic theories and structures that got Russia to this sorry state. We must cast away these foreign theories and look back to the heyday of Russia.

Yet, as he set the bottle down, he couldn't help but worry. He felt what he was doing was for the good of Russia, he swore to himself, and yet he felt himself drifting further from his principles as he climbed into the echelons of the party. But damn was it a long climb.\n\nGumilyov, as he always did, was polishing one of his rough theories, scribbling on an old sheet of paper at his desk. The time was coming when these would be fact, and he had worked hard to near that occasion. He didn't have the same way with words as his father, the poor bastard, but he was having an easy enough time getting an idea out. Shame they wouldn't stay on the page, as he scratched out each halfway decent sentence he wrote. Determination and, for lack of a better term, passion had brought him to this point, but as evidenced by his writer's block: would it bring him any further than this?\n\nTaboritsky, meanwhile, was on a roll. While passion had brought Gumilyov to the top and Shafarevich had planned his way there, Taboritsky rose in a frenzy. That was his constant state. He had to be planning, moving, seething. Thus, while the rest of those in household were asleep, he was tearing through maps ranging from 1600 all the way to 1962.

The Deputy calls out to them too, shouting, "Have a good day! The Government of Komi works only for you!" Muted laughter resounds from the car's cabin and a face reaches out from what must once have been a window. "Have a good day, Deputy! Must be a lonely day in the office, yes?"\n\nThe Deputy, beaming, turns to reply, but the station-wagon's low growl cuts him off before he can say anything. He looks into the massive cloud of smoke, still smiling, and carries on. So it continues through the morning, the sweeping of stray leaves and the urban garbage of Komi's 57th District into giant piles - and the disposal of these piles into burlap sacks.

Receiving orders from the puppet master of the Left, hundreds of fully equipped and well-trained troops converged on the capital of our Republic, heading for government buildings and the National Assembly itself.

In the end, the troops all reached their final destination: the legislative building of the Republic.\n\nAt gunpoint, all members of parliament bar the most loyal Suslovites were swiftly arrested by the military, and the government body, effectively under the control of the putschists, was forced to obey their orders. The Constitution of the Komi Republic has been declared no longer effective, and a new constitution has been hastily drafted, marking the official creation of the Komi Socialist Republic. As for its leader, it is not the puppet master, Suslov himself. Instead, Boris Ponomaryov, well-known as his most trusted ally, has been appointed General Secretary. Suslov himself is merely the Premier of the Republic, preferring to control the new regime from behind the scenes.\n\nWhether the socialist experiment will succeed in Komi remains to be seen, but first, the Suslovite clique that has now seized control will need to properly assert it over the country.

The paths leading in and out of the capital were sealed, placed under guard by advance patrols.Even the river was taken over, as men on boats prevented anyone from taking to their vessels. From there, they too came to assist their comrades.\n\nThe swiftness of their arrival and of their advances caught the forces of the current government off guard. Police were neutralized. And any response by the city's own garrison was met with a greater one. In no time, they were turned.\n\nSeconds turned to minutes. And now, the whole city was secured. Patrols now raced to capture the city hall, leaving bodies and spent casings in their wake. Without their security forces, the current government was no more. Forced to surrender at gunpoint, officials abandoned their buildings, hands up as they streamed into waiting trucks. Those who resisted were beaten into compliance or shot for ceaseless defiance.\n\nBut at last, they have done it. The restoration of the Republic was accomplished, punctuated by the broad declaration of a state of emergency. Soon enough, the victorious Republican Guard and their supporters made ready to greet their returning President.\n\nFrom the steps of the hall of Syktyvkar, the legitimate government can begin its term. Komi is now in good hands, to be devoted to a proper republic, one freed of what no longer can be relied upon."

But they were ambushed, trapped by a hail of fire from the windows above and from the cellars below. And as they battled, so were civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\nConfusion increased as units were lost in the depths of the city. Others were directed to the wrong places by their superiors. The battles became too intense and men began to desert. But the Passionariyy pursued them, even to the river, where men attempted to surrender but instead paid for their loyalty with their lives. Bodies floated down the water as pleas rang throughout.\n\nBridges were taken. Important roads were blocked, secured by patrols. The ways leading out of the city were sealed as were those getting in. Attempts were made to break out for reinforcements or for escape, but they were crushed.\n\nSoon enough, it was all over. They swarmed the hall, intimidating the legislature as they were opening today's session with guns and clubs. They arrested those they had on their lists, adding to them anyone who resisted or was thought to have resisted. Shots were common, and the bodies streamed out as did those who lived to be sent away.\n\nWith the old government dissolved, they made haste to see their constitution instituted. Then, it was declared, their triumph made law as a cheerful Gumilyov was sworn in as the leader of this new government. With the legitimization of their overthrow, the Passionariyy were now in control of what once was the Republic."

The color was seeping from the world, and Valery knew that the people rushing to his body were too late. He knew that he would never talk to his wife again. He ignored the chaos surrounding him, finding happiness in thinking of his wife. He smiled as he thought of her face, her warmth, as the darkness overtook him.\n\nValery Mezhlauk had been shot and killed, the gunman escaping the scene before they could be identified.

He remembered when he was younger, and the stories of Dirlewanger were used to terrify him. Now these children were playing him like he was some sort of villain and not a monster.\n\nKoltsov thought about how his son would react to such games. Would he know the Dirlewanger of stereotypical evil, where he stole young girls so a brave man could save her?

The waters of the river which nourished Syktyvkar and Kotlas, and formed the Republic's border with the Front, were calm, clear, and placid in the fall air.\n\nThe object of Korolkov's attention, however, was no placid vessel. It was a gunboat, the first that the docks of Syktyvkar had purpose-built. Mounted machine-guns ringed her hull, and a single 85mm cannon graced her front deck, taking up the majority of the available space. To the assembled military men, she was beautiful. A beautiful solution to the ugly problem of piracy and smuggling.\n\n"Give the dockworkers my congratulations," began Korolkov, surveying the radio antenna on her stout command center.\n\nLigachev nodded. "They've been paid double for laying her down. We'll be getting you another four, provided funding holds up - two more for the Sysola, and two for the Vyatka."\n\nThe newly promoted commanding officer of the Komi Republican Navy stared intently into the water. Yes, this would do nicely. All his lobbying and harassing the Defense Minister had finally managed to procure a solution, and he was damn well going to show what river supremacy could do for the Republic."

 yakovlev.1.d:0 "Out of all the Deputies to come from the former Front territory, none has attracted as much attention as the recent election of Alexander Yakovlev, affiliated with the DSNP. Born to a peasant family in Korolyovo, his father served as a Red Cavalryman in the Civil War and became a leader of a small Collective farm in his village. Yakovlev served in the Red Army during the German invasion, and the horrors he experienced on the Front, including almost losing an arm during the invasion.\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fracturing of the country into multiple warlords, Yakovlev's life had been shattered, as the strength and truth of Marxist-Leninism right in front of his eyes. The destruction of his country and ideology forced him to look at Socialism through a different lens, one in which human happiness and quality of life trumped ideological purity.\n\nAfter winning a difficult election in the recently conquered Arkhangelsk Oblast against the wishes of the DSNP establishment, he has established himself as a prominent freshman in the Oblast. Intelligent and reform minded, it remains to be seen whether his left wing credentials can gain him the political power he desires."

 yakovlev.2.d:0 "Despite only having been elected a few months ago, Alexander Yakovlev, a freshman Deputy of the DSNP, has since made himself known as an influential political operator both within and without of the party. He has been instrumental to the Democratic Front in helping ensure party loyalty among Deputies coming from the former Front and elsewhere. While technically coming from a new territory, Yakovlev has been succeeding in straddling the line between being associated either with the party establishment in Syktyvkar or the frontier, making himself out as a possible unifier in the young republic.\n\nHowever, his desire for compromise extends only so far, as many on the right of the DSNP are well aware. Yakovlev's public criticism of those in his own party who have 'betrayed our socialist roots' has made him popular among leftists in Komi. While his economic policies are far from radical in Russia, his forcefulness in such criticism has since made him a prominent member of the left of his party.\n\nWhile still young and inexperienced in the ways of government, it is expected among the party establishment that he will do great things."

A powerful political operative, known for his reformist and socialist tendencies, Yakovlev has gained a following among younger intellectuals, working class trade unionists, and citizens of the Front territory, all of which have made him a powerful figure on the left wing of the party.\n\nWhile once a freshman Deputy from Korolyovo, he has since raised his status as a popular figure among socialists and other leftists within the DSNP, much to the chagrin of the party's right wing. With his fiery criticism of the right DSNP's liberal economic policies and a firebrand desire to uplift the working class of his nation through a newfound humanistic socialism, many expect Yakovlev to seek the Presidency.\n\nAlthough he has kept any hints of seeking the presidency to himself, it remains to be seen if Yakovlev's coalition can overcome the party establishment."

While his popularity was far from what it once was, he has been able to keep the young and unstable Republic from breaking apart.\n\nVoznesensky has not explicitly endorsed a successor, although it is expected he is to endorse his Party's primary winner for the 1971 election.

Originally considered a dark horse candidate for the party, he narrowly beat out his moderate opponent.\n\nFor years, Yakovlev has been representing the DSNP's left wing for years, advocating for a stronger left wing economic policy, and has led the charge against the party's economic liberalization. This, combined with his support among the former Front held regions, has now catapulted him into his status as a major Presidential candidate.\n\nWhile many on the right of the DSNP grumble about Yakovlev, the center and left wing are openly congratulating the candidate on his victory, and are expected to have even greater representation in the National Assembly. Whether he can win the Presidency, however, remains to be seen."

While the right may balk at us, the workers of this nation know who their true enemy is.'\n\nAlexander Yakovlev's speech officially announcing his candidacy for the President of the Komi Republic has been well received by many on the left wing of the Democratic Front and beyond. While his candidacy has just been announced, Yakovlev has met with many trade unionists in both core Komi territory and in former Front territory, which were all met with positivity among working class voters and trade union bureaucracy.\n\nWhile many considered Alexander Yakovlev to be a dark horse in the People's Democratic Socialist Party's primary, his unexpected victory has since capitulated his already impressive political record to new heights. His powerful political connections in the Front's former territory, in addition to his harsh criticism of the right wing of his party, has made him the darling of the left within the Komi Republic. It remains to be seen, however, whether he can succeed his predecessor in maintaining order and stability within our young nation."

However, internal polling reveals a rather concerning trend within the coalition - with our current number of 'confirmed' votes it seems that if any more dissensions at all are to take place within the governing coalition, the budget will fail, and the Republic's government will be paralyzed for months.\n\nIn the wake of the discovery of this distressing trend within the party, the President of the Republic has been forced to make a decision. The budget could be handed to Alexei Kosygin, leader of the "Young Reformists" Party and talented economist, or it could be kept as-is, and strings pulled to ensure that the vote goes our way.

To pass the bill, there are two proposed strategies. Either roll back some of the proposals to get Kosygin's party back on board, or try to get Zhdanov's faction of the KKP to vote with the government by promising the military contracts will be awarded to council-run industries associated with his support base.

Alexei Kosygin of the Union of Young Reformers was highly critical of the bill for its cuts to internal spending, particularly on social security, and almost two thirds of the party's representatives refused to vote for it. That is when the Communist Party unexpectedly came to the President's rescue, the majority of their representatives voting for the new budget on grounds of its importance in protecting national industry and securing the Revolution.\n\nThe budget thus passed with a comfortable majority, and President Voznesensky is expected to hold a press conference tonight thanking his allies and those opponents who supported the bill. All may however not be a bed of roses for the President in the future, as Lev Gumilyov and Igor Shafarevich have issued a joint press statement that they will conduct a thorough internal investigation both of the members of Shafarevich' circle who backed the bill without checking it for communist infiltration, and of the government's own potential collaboration with the KKP.

Needless to say, passing this bill would strengthen the Communists considerably, as they are already doing well among the natives and this bill would enshrine them as the party of native rights. As such, the Passionaries want the bill voted down, on the grounds of mandatory native representation being undemocratic in a system preaching one man, one vote. Of course, in reality their chief concern is the threat a strengthened Communist Party could present. As a compromise, the native Komi SMR representative Ivan Morozov has drafted a bill that would guarantee the natives access to local government and a heavier vote weight in Assembly elections, but no mandatory lower limit on native representation. The Center have rallied around this proposal, though many in the SMR and DSNP are clearly more sympathetic to the Communist's Mandated Minority Representation Bill. What will the Assembly conclude?"

The DSNP is in full damage control mode trying to avoid an impeachment push led by the enraged Passionaryy, while the coalition is reeling. The KKP, on the other hand, have no comment on the matter beyond stating that there is nothing in the leaks proving that the Communist leaders involved, most prominently Andrey Zhdanov, had any knowledge of how the "gifts" from the President were done illegally. The President himself has locked himself in his office, from where he has been trying to call somebody all day without luck. Our administration may be history."

 komi_zhdanov_demand.9.d:0 "Alone, in a dacha on the outskirts of Syktyvkar, Andrey Zhdanov was smiling as he was going through his papers and documents. Yes, it was all there. He wrote a note to his secretary detailing how to distribute the files to the correct recipients, then stopped and looked at his desk, at the framed photograph of him and Voznesetsky drinking coffee, or at least what passed for it these days, at the very same dacha four years earlier.\n\n"Quite clever, wasn't I Nikolai? Poor, trusting man. You never had it in you to fully separate public and private life."\n\nHis smile faded. "Had you been wiser you would have tried to end it sooner, but your pride wouldn't allow you, would it? You wouldn't have done the same in my position, which is why it had to be done. We must all give something, for the Republic, for Russia, for the Revolution."\n\nHe sighed and flipped the picture to face down, before picking up the next pile of documents to be leaked to the press. On his way out the door, he cast a glimpse back over his shoulder before flipping the light switch. "Goodbye, old friend."\n\nThen the light went out, the door closed, and the moment was gone."
